The economy of Bangladesh is significantly dependent on agriculture. But it’s great news for the country that, garments sector (RMG) sector of Bangladesh has raised as the biggest earner of foreign currency. This sector creates about 4.2 million employment opportunities anReady madeutes significantly to the GDP. Readymade garments (RMG) of Bangladesh is powered by young, urbanizing, workers, where most of them are women. History of RMG Sector in Bangladesh: The foundation of the textile sector was first established in the 60th decade of the 19th century. For the first time, the industry exported shirts (Mercury shirts) to the European market in 1965-66, which was produced from Karachi. In the latter, 9 exporting industries were available in 1977-78. The three largest industries at that time were Riaz Garments, Jewel Garments, and Paris Garments. Among those, Riaz Garments was the most famous and oldest industry at that time. In the earlier stage, Riaz Garments of Mohammad Reaz Uddin started its business with some tailoring shop in the name of Riaz store. Later, the name turned into Riaz Garments from the Riaz store in 1973, and from 1978 the company started exporting products abroad by exporting 1 million pieces of shirts in the South Korean Company named “Olanda”. “Desh Garments is another pioneer of the Bangladesh RMG sector. In 1979, Desh Garments started a joint project with the South Korean company “Daiyuu”. At the same time, several garments were introduced such as-Stylecraft limited by Shamsur Rahman, Aristocraft Limited by AM Subid Ali, Azim Group by Engineer Mohammad Fazlul Azim, and Sunman Group by Major (Retd) Abdul Mannan. By following the beginners of the RMG sector, some other discreet and hard- working entrepreneurs started their RMG business in the country. From there, the RMG sector of Bangladesh was developing day by day and did not need to look back. Though this sector had passed various critical stages through the path. In that time, we learned about child labor in 1994, and in 1995 we made our garments industry free from child labor very successfully. ","35 Present Situation of RMG Sector in Bangladesh: The quota system was a great blessing for establishing our garments industry. We were strongly benefited from using that. As a result, we can see a matured garment industry today. But while the quota system was approaching an end in 2004, there are so many who got upset about the RMG sector of Bangladesh. Though in the latter it can’t be affected here as the experts seemed. We conquered the post-quota challenges and made that a successful story. In the RMG sector of Bangladesh, there are more than 5000 garment factories (private statistics) at the current time, employing more than 12 lakh laborers, where 85% of the labor force is women. But, according to BGMEA the number of garment factories in Bangladesh is around 4000. Now, the RMG industry is the country's largest export earner with a value of over $24.49bn of exports in the last financial year. It’s great news for us that Bangladesh is clearly ahead of other South Asian suppliers in terms of the capacity of the ready-made garments industry. Though there are various types of garments manufactured in Bangladesh, all the ready-made garments are classified into two broad categories, where one is woven products and another one is knitted products. Woven products include Shirts, Pants, and Trousers. On the other hand, the knitted product includes T-Shirts, Polo Shirts, Undergarments, Socks, Stockings, and Sweaters. Woven garments still dominate the export earnings of the country. From the BGMEA website, it’s seen that Day by day knitted items production is increasing at a considerable rate and now about 40% export earnings have been achieved from knitted products. Contribution of RMG Sector to the National Economy: The role of the RMG sector in Bangladesh’s economy is remarkable. It’s seen that, from the last decade, the RMG sector contributes to the national economy at a considerable rate. About 76% of the total export earnings come from the RMG sector. From statistics, it’s known that in FY 2003-04 RMG sector of Bangladesh earned US$ 5,686.06 million, in FY 2004-05 the value was US$ 6,417.67.67 million, in FY 2005-06 the value was US$ 7900.80 million, in FY 2006-07 the value was US$ 9,211.23 million, in FY 2007-08 the value was US$ 10,699.80 million, in FY 2008-09 the value was US$ 12.35 billion and finally in FY 2013-14 the value stands at $24.49billion. Contribution of RMG sector to the National Economy ","36 The opportunity of RMG Sector in Bangladesh: The RMG sector of Bangladesh has some key factors which inspired the steady growth of this sector. Though it’s a matter of great surprise for so many that the RMG sector of Bangladesh continues to show its robust performance in the world. The main key factors which have a great influence on the RMG sector of Bangladesh are the following: ● Vast labor force, ● Skilled human resources, ● Technological upgrades, ● Government supports for textile and clothing, ● Special economic/export processing zones, ● Creation of textile and clothing villages, ● The incentive for use of local inputs, ● Duty reduction for the import of inputs/machines, ● Income tax reduction, ● And international supports like GSP, GSP+, duty-free access, etc. By using the above key points we can easily take the world's readymade garments market very strongly. But there are some other key factors. If we apply those key factors in our readymade garments sector, then we will achieve the priority to the world’s famous buyers’ notebook. Those key factors are- ● Cost-Effective Strategy, ● New Product Development strategy, ● Product Diversification Strategy and ● Market Diversification Strategy. Cost-Effective Strategy: Cost-Effective Strategy includes the following two key points: ● Cost Reduction Strategy and ● Labor Productivity Improvement. ","37 Those key points are discussed below: 1. Cost Reduction Strategy: Cost reduction strategy should begin with assigning the highest priority for establishing backward linkages. The establishment of backward linkages will reduce our dependence on foreign sources which will reduce the total and average production cost of garments. This Strategy will make our products more competitive in the world’s ready-made garments market. 2. Labor Productivity Improvement: Bangladeshi workers are not as efficient as Hong Kong, South Korea, and Sri Lankan workers. Wages are low in Bangladesh, but it does not necessarily mean that relatively low wages workers automatically lead to higher productivity. So, to keep the place in the world’s largest competitive market, labor productivity must be improved. New Product Development strategy: It’s a matter of great sorrow for us that we regularly produce the same products. Our product categories are very less in quantity. Our product items that are exported into the foreign market are Shirts-60%, Jackets-11%, Knit items-10%, Trousers-7%, and Others-11.50%. To survive in the world’s most competitive RMG market, we have to develop new product items with a lot of variations. Product Diversification Strategy: Product Diversification Strategy is an important factor to keep the place in the world’s ready made garments market. Different types of products should be produced by applying fashion. Thailand, China, India, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and others are the main competitors of Bangladesh. They are already ahead of Bangladesh in product diversification strategy areas. Market Diversification Strategy: Bangladesh has exported its products to the world’s limited market. Most are in the USA, Canada, and Europe. About 46% of its total garment exports go to the USA, 14% to Canada, and the rest of those into the European market. The competitors of Bangladesh have regularly expanded their markets and keep changing their products by using fashion. ","38 The following key factors must be undertaken during a market diversification strategy: ● Market research on product design ● Market research on product development, ● Market promotion through trade fairs, exhibitions, etc. ● Human resources development by providing training. Challenges for RMG Sector of Bangladesh: Though the RMG sector of Bangladesh has achieved the second spot for the highest number of garments exporter, it has a lot of problems. The major problems faced by the RMG sector currently is the lack of safety in the working place and working conditions for the millions of garment workers. It’s become a great challenge for the upcoming fiscal year of Bangladesh. Another important one is political stability. Two major incidents in the RMG sector of Bangladesh are the Tazreen fire and the Rana Plaza collapse, which have brought the issue of workplace safety to the fore and led all stakeholders to act accordingly. But it’s good news for the RMG sector that, following the unfortunate incidents, various platforms such as the Bangladesh Accord on Fire and Building Safety, the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety, and the National Plan of Action have been formed to improve building and fire safety of Bangladesh’s garment industry. Also, BGMEA and BKMEA are working together here to solve such kinds of problems. They have also taken necessary actions and invested a huge amount of money. It’s a huge responsibility for the government of Bangladesh to ensure working place safety in all the garments manufacturing factories. If we can’t do it, foreign buyers will refuse to place orders here, which will be a massive blow for the RMG sector of Bangladesh. We hope the government of Bangladesh, BGMEA, and BKMEA, with the support of global brands and international development partners, will be able to ensure the safety of the RMG industry and maintain the momentum of socio- economic development in the country. Political stability creates a negative impact on the RMG sector of Bangladesh. If it continues, it will be a massive blow to destroy our most valuable sector. So, political leaders should come out immediately to solve such kinds of problems. ","39 Hoping for RMG Sector of Bangladesh: According to the McKinsey survey, it’s seen that 86 percent of the chief purchasing officers in leading apparel companies in Europe and the United States planned to decrease levels of sourcing in China over the next five years because of declining profit margins and capacity constraints. Also, they said in that survey, “Western buyers are evaluating a considerable number of sourcing options in the Far East and Southeast Asia, many chief purchasing officers said in the survey that they view Bangladesh as the next hot spot”. Many chief purchasing officers mentioned Bangladesh as the hot spot in the readymade garments market.Hoping for RMG sector of Bangladesh A McKinsey survey also reported that, with about $15 billion in exports in 2010, ready- made garments are the country’s most important industrial sector; which represents 13% and more than 75% of GDP and total exports, respectively. McKinsey forecasts export-value growth of 7 to 9% annually within the next ten years, so the market will double by 2015 and nearly triple by 2020. It’s a prime duty for us to provide a perfect working place for the readymade garments sector of Bangladesh which has given our economy a strong footing, created jobs for millions of people, especially for women, lifted them from the abyss of chronic poverty, and given them a magnificent life. Now what we have needed to do is dealing with all the challenges facing our readymade garments industry, paving the way for its further development.

","46 CHAPTER 1:ALL ABOUT FABRIC/TEXTILE/CLOTH ","47 What is Fabric? As per the definition, “A textile is a flexible material made by creating an interlocking bundle of yarns or threads, which are produced by spinning raw fibers (from either natural or synthetic sources) into long and twisted lengths.Textiles are then formed by weaving, knitting, crocheting, knotting, tatting, felting, bonding, or braiding these yarns together.” The related words \"fabric\" and \"cloth\" and \"material\" are often used in textile assembly trades (such as tailoring and dressmaking) as synonyms for textile. However, there are subtle differences in these terms in specialized usage. A textile is any material made of interlacing fibers, including carpeting and geotextiles, which may not necessarily be used in the production of further goods, such as clothing and upholstery. Fabric is a material made through weaving, knitting, spreading, felting, stitching, crocheting or bonding that may be used in the production of further products, such as clothing and upholstery, thus requiring a further step of the production. Cloth may also be used synonymously with fabric, but often specifically refers to a piece of fabric that has been processed or cut.” Etymology: The word 'textile' comes from the Latin adjective textilis, meaning 'woven', which itself stems from textus, the past participle of the verb texere, 'to weave. Originally applied to woven fabrics, the term \"textiles\" is now used to encompass a diverse range of materials, including fibers, yarns, and fabrics, as well as other related items. The word 'fabric' also derives from Latin, with roots in the Proto-Indo-European language. Stemming most recently from the Middle French fabrique, or 'building, a thing made', and earlier from the Latin fabrica ('workshop; an art, trade; a skilful production, structure, fabric'), the noun fabrica stems from the Latin Faber, or 'artisan who works in hard materials', which itself is derived from the Proto-Indo- European dhabh-, meaning 'to fit together’. The word 'cloth' derives from the Old English clað, meaning a 'cloth, woven or felted ","48 material to wrap around one's body', from the Proto-Germanic kalithaz, similar to the Old Frisian klath, the Middle Dutch cleet, the Middle High German kleit and the German kleid, all meaning 'garment'. Fiber sources and types: Textiles are made from many materials, with four main sources: animal (wool, silk), plant (cotton, flax, jute, bamboo), mineral (asbestos, glass fiber), and synthetic (nylon, polyester, acrylic, rayon). Wool Woolen Yarn The first three are natural. In the 20th century, they were supplemented by artificial fibers made from petroleum. Textiles are made in various strengths and degrees of durability, from the finest microfibre made of strands thinner than one denier to the sturdiest canvas. Textile manufacturing terminology has a wealth of descriptive terms, from light gauze-like gossamer to heavy grosgrain cloth and beyond. Animal Animal textiles are commonly made from hair, fur, skin or silk (in the case of silkworms). Wool refers to the hair of the domestic sheep or goat, which is distinguished from other types of animal hair in that the individual strands are coated with scales and tightly crimped, and the wool as a whole is coated with a wax mixture known as ","49 lanolin (sometimes called wool grease), which is waterproof and dirtproof. The lanolin and other contaminants are removed from the raw wool before further processing. Woolen refers to a yarn produced from carded, non-parallel fiber, while worsted refers to a finer yarn spun from longer fibers that have been combed to be parallel. Wool is commonly used for warm clothing. Other animal textiles which are made from hair or fur are alpaca wool, vicuña wool, llama wool, and camel hair, generally used in the production of coats, jackets, ponchos, blankets, and other warm coverings. Cashmere, the hair of the Indian cashmere goat, and mohair, the hair of the North African angora goat, are types of wool known for their softness. Used in the production of sweaters and scarfs. Angora refers to the long, thick, soft hair of the angora rabbit. Qiviut is the fine inner wool of the muskox. Silk is an animal textile made from the fibers of the cocoon of the Chinese silkworm which is spun into a smooth fabric prized for its softness. There are two main types of silk: 'mulberry silk' produced by the Bombyx Mori, and 'wild silk' such as Tussah silk (wild silk). Silkworm larvae produce the first type if cultivated in habitats with fresh mulberry leaves for consumption, while Tussah silk is produced by silkworms feeding purely on oak leaves. Around four-fifths of the world's silk production consists of cultivated silk. Silk production consists of pillow covers, dresses, tops, skirts, bed sheets, curtains. Plant Grass, rush, hemp, and sisal are all used in making rope. In the first two, the entire plant is used for this purpose, while in the last two, only fibers from the plant are ","50 utilized. Coir (coconut fiber) is used in making twine, and also in floor mats, doormats, brushes, mattresses, floor tiles, and sacking. Straw and bamboo are both used to make hats. Straw, a dried form of grass, is also used for stuffing, as is kapok. Fibers from pulpwood trees, cotton, rice, hemp, and nettle are used in making paper. Cotton, flax, jute, hemp, modal and even banana and bamboo fiber are all used in clothing. Piña (pineapple fiber) and ramie are also fibers used in clothing, generally with a blend of other fibers such as cotton. Nettles have also been used to make a fiber and fabric very similar to hemp or flax. The use of milkweed stalk fiber has also been reported, but it tends to be somewhat weaker than other fibers like hemp or flax. The inner bark of the lacebark tree is a fine netting that has been used to make clothing and accessories as well as utilitarian articles such as rope. Acetate is used to increase the shininess of certain fabrics such as silks, velvets, and taffetas. Seaweed is used in the production of textiles: a water-soluble fiber known as alginate is produced and is used as a holding fiber; when the cloth is finished, the alginate is dissolved, leaving an open area. Rayon is a manufactured fabric derived from plant pulp. Different types of rayon can imitate the feel and texture of silk, cotton, wool, or linen. Fibers from the stalks of plants, such as hemp, flax, and nettles, are also known as 'bast' fibers. Hemp Fiber is a yellowish-brown fiber made from the hemp plant. The fiber characteristics are coarser, harsher, strong and lightweight. Hemp fiber is used primarily to make twine, rope and cordage. ","51 Mineral Asbestos and basalt fiber are used for vinyl tiles, sheeting and adhesives, \"transite\" panels and siding, acoustical ceilings, stage curtains, and fire blankets. Glass fiber is used in the production of the ironing board and mattress covers, ropes and cables, reinforcement fiber for composite materials, insect netting, flame-retardant and protective fabric, soundproof, fireproof, and insulating fibers. Glass fibers are woven and coated with Teflon to produce beta cloth, a virtually fireproof fabric which has replaced nylon in the outer layer of United States space suits since 1968. Metal fiber, metal foil, and metal wire have a variety of uses, including the production of cloth-of-gold and jewelry. Hardware cloth (US term only) is a coarse woven mesh of steel wire, used in construction. It is much like standard window screening, but heavier and with a more open weave. Minerals and natural and synthetic fabrics may be combined, as in emery cloth, a layer of emery abrasive glued to a cloth backing. Also, \"sand cloth\" is a U.S. term for fine wire mesh with abrasive glued to it, employed like emery cloth or coarse sandpaper. Synthetic Synthetic textiles are used primarily in the production of clothing, as well as the manufacture of geotextiles. Synthetic fibers are those that are chemically ","52 constructed, therefore are unsustainable. Polyester fiber is used in all types of clothing, either alone or blended with fibers such as cotton. Aramid fiber (e.g. Twaron) is used for flame- retardant clothing, cut-protection, and armor. Acrylic is a fiber used to imitate wools, including cashmere, and is often used in replacement of them. Nylon is a fiber used to imitate silk; it is used in the production of pantyhose. Thicker nylon fibers are used in rope and outdoor clothing. Spandex (trade name Lycra) is a polyurethane product that can be made tight-fitting without impeding movement. It is used to make activewear, bras, and swimsuits. Olefin fiber is a fibre used in activewear, linings, and warm clothing. Olefins are hydrophobic, allowing them to dry quickly. A sintered felt of ","53 olefin fibers is sold under the trade name Tyvek. Ingeo is a polylactide fiber blended with other fibers such as cotton and used in clothing. It is more hydrophilic than most other synthetics, allowing it to wick away perspiration. Lurex is a metallic fiber used in clothing embellishment. Milk proteins have also been used to create synthetic fabric. Milk or casein fiber cloth was developed during World War I in Germany and further developed in Italy and America during the 1930s. Milk fiber fabric is not very durable and wrinkles easily, but has a pH similar to human skin and possesses antibacterial properties. It is marketed as a biodegradable, renewable synthetic fiber. Carbon fiber is mostly used in composite materials, together with resin, such as carbon fiber reinforced plastic. The fibers are made from polymer fibers through carbonization. ","54 Blends (Blended textiles) Fabric or yarn produced with a combination of two or more types of different fibers, or yarns to obtain desired traits. Blending is possible at various stages of textile manufacturing. The final composition is liable for the properties of the resultant product. Natural and Synthetic fibers are blended to overcome the disadvantages of single fiber properties and to achieve better performance characteristics and aesthetic effects such as devoré, heather effect, cross dyeing and stripes pattern etc. Clothing woven from a blend of cotton and polyester can be more durable and easier to maintain than material woven solely from cotton. Other than sharing functional properties, blending makes the products more economical. Union or Union fabrics is the 19th-century term for blended fabrics. It is no longer used. ''Mixture'' or ''Mixed cloth'' is another term used for blended cloths when different types of yarns are used in warp and weft sides. Blended textiles are not new. Mashru was a 16th-century fabric, one of the earliest forms of \"mixed cloth,\" a material composed of silk and cotton.Siamoise was a 17th-century cotton and linen material. Composition Fiber composition, the fiber blend composition of mixtures of the fibers, is an important criterion to analyze the behavior, properties such as functional aspects, and commercial classification of the merchandise. The most common blend is cotton and polyester. Regular blended fabric is 65% ","55 Polyester and 35% Cotton. It is called a ''reverse blend'' if the ratio of cotton predominates—the percentage of the fibers changes with the price and required properties. Blending adds value to the textiles; it helps in reducing the cost (Artificial fibers are less expensive than natural fibers) and adding advantage in properties of the final product. For instance, a small amount of spandex adds stretch to the fabrics. Wool can add warmth. Shell Fabric This is a term particularly used for outdoor clothing – trekking, mountaineering, etc. A shell fabric is the outer layer of warm clothing, often the outer layer of an insulated jacket, or it can be a single-layer outer jacket or shirt. Our training kit windshirts, jackets and trousers are all outer shell items made from shell fabrics, in this case, Taslan. They are very adaptable garments and can be used not just for cold weather training and travel, but for other outdoor pursuits. The ideal shell fabric: ● Keeps out water, to help keep the inner layers dry and minimize heat loss from conductance. ● Is breathable, to prevent sweat from building up and making the inner layers damp (as well as feeling unpleasant to play in). ● Is windproof, to minimize wind chill. Air is an excellent insulator but you need a windproof layer to keep the warmed pockets of air in place. ","56 Taffeta Fabric Taffeta is the ultimate fabric for special occasions, forming iconic ball gowns and evening wear used frequently by iconic designers like Coco Chanel and Christian Dior. The crisp, shiny fabric, made from silk, polyester, or nylon, creates beautiful silhouettes and is considered an ideal fabric for creating high fashion looks. What Is Taffeta? Taffeta is a crisp, plain-woven fabric made most often from silk, but it can also be woven with polyester, nylon, acetate, or other synthetic fibers. Taffeta fabric typically has a lustrous, shiny appearance. Taffeta can vary in weight from light to medium and in levels of sheerness, depending on the type of fiber used and the tightness of the weave. Taffeta was first produced in the Middle East in the twelfth century, and the word taffeta comes from the Persian word “taftah” meaning “crisp, woven.” Taffeta Can be Polyester or Nylon. How Is Taffeta Made? Taffeta is made using the plain-weave technique, which has a single weft thread going over and under a single warp thread, creating a checkerboard pattern. What makes taffeta unique is that the threads are twisted as they are woven, which ","57 creates the stiffness and structure of the resulting fabric. Taffeta was originally made from silk, but in the twentieth century, manufacturers began weaving taffeta out of semi-synthetic fibers like rayon and synthetic fibers like nylon, polyester, and acetate. Polyester taffeta is the most popular type of taffeta today, as it is inexpensive and mimics silk well. Characteristics of Taffeta: Taffeta is considered a high-end fabric, with a beautiful, smooth surface and unique characteristics. Crisp: Taffeta fabric is crisp and holds its shape well as a result of the tightly twisted yarns woven together in a plain weave fashion. Shine: Taffeta has a lustrous shine that is unique to the fabric and comes from the innate qualities of silk or polyester. Smooth: Taffeta fabric also has a smooth surface, and piece-dyed taffeta in particular is especially soft. Sound: Taffeta, especially yarn-dyed taffeta, makes a rustling sound called “scroop” (combination of scrape and woop) when it rubs together. Advantages of Taffeta: Luxurious: Taffeta is a shimmery, crisp fabric that has created many iconic looks. The shimmer comes from the type of fiber used to make taffeta, such as silk or rayon. Pliable: Taffeta is a stiff fabric that can create a beautiful, structural silhouette. Taffeta also doesn’t lose its shape over time. Doesn’t pill: Taffeta fabric doesn’t pill and maintains its smooth surface. Disadvantages of Taffeta: Hard to work with: The material is slippery and can be hard to maneuver with a sewing machine. To make taffeta a little bit easier to work with, try pre-washing the fabric to make it softer and use a sharp needle. Expensive: Silk taffeta can be very expensive because of the cost of silk. However, ","58 polyester taffeta is much more affordable. Stiff: Taffeta doesn’t have much stretch to so it’s not ideal for items where flexibility is needed. Snags easily: Since the fibers are so fine and delicate, the fabric can snag easily and create pulls. How Is Taffeta Used? Taffeta is a red carpet staple, but it’s also used often in costumes and home decor. Home decor: The heavier, stiffer forms of taffeta create beautiful, flowing window curtains. Taffeta is also sometimes used for wallpaper. Evening gowns: Taffeta really shines when used for dressmaking. From evening dresses to wedding dresses to prom dresses, taffeta is a staple of fashion thanks to its lustrous appearance and the beautiful shapes the texture creates. Corsets: Taffeta is also frequently used for undergarments like corsets, where the stiff fabric is needed to hold in the waistline and create a silhouette. Linings: Piece-dyed silk taffeta is great for lining jackets, as the fabric is both decorative and soft to touch. Parachutes: Piece-dyed silk taffeta was used for creating parachutes in World War II. 6 Different Types of Taffeta Shot silk taffeta: This is a type of silk taffeta where the warp and the weft threads are different colors, which creates a beautiful iridescent effect. Warp-printed taffeta: This type of silk taffeta has the warp threads printed before weaving, which creates a pastel pattern of varied colors. It was very popular in France in the eighteenth century. Paper taffeta: Paper taffeta is an extremely thin, lightweight form of taffeta that has a paper-like consistency. Antique taffeta: Antique taffeta is woven from unevenly spun yarns, which leads to ","59 slight bumps in the material from the inconsistencies. Faille taffeta: This type is made from staple fibers, which are short-length fibers like cotton or wool. Stretch-taffeta: Stretch taffeta is a type of fabric that incorporates spandex into the weave for added stretch and flexibility. Fabric Care Guide: How Do You Care for Taffeta? Taffeta should be dry cleaned or hand-washed with cold water. Silk taffeta always needs to be dry-cleaned; however, taffeta made from synthetic fibers can be washed at home. Here are some guidelines for washing synthetic taffeta: ● Wash with cold water.Hot water can cause dyes to bleed. ● Use gentle detergent. ● Do not wring or twist the garment to avoid damaging the fabric and ruining the shape. ● Hang to dry in a well-ventilated area not in direct sunlight. ● Use a low-heat iron if needed. Contrast fabric Contrast fabric is a term used in sewing used to refer to a fabric piece or embellishment made from a different fabric than the main fabric. The term contrast fabric directly contrasts with the term self-fabric. Contrast fabric is used in certain pattern pieces such as facings and linings to produce design details that stand out from the rest of the garment. It is also used as embellishment, such as in ric rac, piping) or appliqué. For example, to make buttons a design feature, a special type of button is often covered in the contrasting fabric. ","60 Sherpa Fabric Sherpa’s trademark is its super soft and luxurious texture. Generally resembling wool or sheepskin; Sherpa Fabric is the perfect eco-friendly alternative to fleece. What is Sherpa? Sherpa fabric resembles the wool-lined clothing worn by the tribe. It is named after the Sherpa people living in Nepal. However, contrary to what the Sherpa people wear; the fabric is typically made of pure cotton; a synthetic fiber like polyester; or a blend of cotton and synthetic fibers. Sherpa is also called faux-sheepskin or faux-shearling. The fabric has two sides. One is the stitched wooly side with a soft and bumpy texture comparable to real fleece; the other side is a smooth knit shell.Together, they make a sherpa material that is both warm and durable. How is Sherpa Fabric made? Sherpa is made from polyester fabric but has some stretch to it. It is not made from wool, although it has that look. Sherpa fleece has two sides — one is a smooth knit, the other is textured to look like fleece from sheep. Sherpa Fabric Characteristics ● Sherpa Gives Comfortable Insulation: One of the best-known characteristics of sherpa is its excellent ability to retain warmth and preserve heat. Because fabric has two sides, the smooth side, and the furry lining, it creates strong insulation. It also provides protection against the wind and cold weather. Using a blanket with a sherpa lining is akin to sinking into ultra-soft and fluffy clouds. Combined with its amazing heat insulation, a sherpa-lined baby blanket is an ultimate baby must-have in the winter. ● Sherpa wicks away moisture: Sherpa is actually a quick-drying material, making it perfect for your baby to use. Similar to pure cotton, sherpa effectively wicks away moisture, keeping your baby warm and dry. ● It’s easy to maintain: Speaking of practicality, sherpa is not as high- maintenance as it may sound. In fact, it is very easy to launder. Usually, all you ","61 need to do to maintain a sherpa-lined baby blanket is to wipe the stains off, wash it in cold water, and use a mild baby-friendly detergent. ● It is lightweight and less bulky: With all of these awesome qualities of sherpa, you may expect that the fabric is heavy and bulky. This could not be farther from the truth. Despite its thickness and plushness, the sherpa material is actually lightweight and not bulky! Sherpa feels delicate and luxurious, but a sherpa-lined baby blanket will not feel like a weighted blanket. On the contrary, because sherpa is so lightweight, you can actually have it in the car or in the stroller to keep your baby warm and cozy wherever you go. ● It is Stylish: Sherpa definitely adds flair to any product, especially baby blankets. When added to a soft sherpa side, baby blankets become even more pretty and adorable. This fluffy material makes an otherwise ordinary blanket extraordinary. Mesh Fabric What Is Mesh Fabric? There are a few different versions of mesh fabric, but this type of fabric is typified by its lightweight heft and permeable texture. Unlike most types of fabric, which feature closely-woven textures, mesh is woven loosely, which results in thousands of tiny holes being present in each mesh garment. The idea of mesh has been around for thousands of years; for instance, every type of net in existence is made from mesh, and this material has also been used to make items like hammocks. However, it wasn't until the end of the 19th century that textile innovators started using mesh for apparel. British mill owner Lewis Haslam came up with the idea to use mesh for fabric when he was out for a walk with his aunt in cold weather. He noticed that her gloves were riddled with holes, but when he questioned her about them, she maintained that her hands were still warm. Intrigued, Haslam started experimenting with loosely-knit fabrics, and he went on to ","62 found a textile company called Aertex, which was the world's first producer of mesh fabric. Aertex is no longer the sole supplier of mesh fabric, but by the mid-1980s, textiles made by this company had become so popular that they were frequently worn by popular culture icons on MTV. This surge of popularity was partially fueled by the adoption of Airtex mesh fabric as the primary sportswear material for the international shoe and apparel company Adidas. Starting in the 1980s, a variety of other companies started making mesh, and in the ensuing years, a number of subtypes of this fabric have emerged. In almost every case, mesh is made from synthetic materials like polyester and nylon. Some fabric experts contend that the weave style used in Polo shirts by popular brands like Lacoste is also a type of mesh, but since there is significant disagreement regarding this designation, in this article, we'll only touch on traditional mesh fabric and its variants such as power mesh and powernet. How Is Mesh Fabric Made? Mesh fabric is made with a variety of different techniques depending on the type of fiber from which it is composed. While nylon and polyester are very similar in a number of ways, polyester was developed a few decades after nylon, which means that the production of this synthetic material follows significantly more advanced manufacturing processes. Though the processes used to make these two types of fabric fibers differ, for each type of fiber, the process begins with the refining of petroleum oil. Polyamide monomers are then extracted from this oil, and these monomers are then reacted with various forms of acid to make polymers. These polymers are usually solid after they are reacted, and they are then melted and forced through spinnerets to make polymer strands. Once these strands have cooled, they can be loaded onto spools and shipped to textile manufacturing facilities to be made into mesh fabric. In most cases, manufacturers of mesh fabric will dye their polyester or nylon fibers before they weave them into fabric. Textile manufacturers can then weave these fibers in a number of different ways to create various forms of mesh. Many types of mesh, for instance, follow a basic square pattern that has proven itself effective over ","63 thousands of years. More contemporary forms of mesh, however, such as Tulle, may be woven with a hexagonal structure. How Is Mesh Fabric Used? If you like to fish, you may have used a fishing net made from mesh, and this fabric is also used to make net bags and a variety of other net products. While a bolt of mesh fabric resembles a net no matter how many holes per inch (HPI) it features, the denser that mesh fabric becomes, the less transparent it is, which makes it more suitable for various types of apparel. The use of mesh as a fabric was originally popularized by its utilization in sportswear. From shorts to shirts to sports bras, this fabric took the sporting world by storm in the mid-1980s, and it has remained popular ever since. This material is particularly popular in sports jerseys; whether they are used in football, rugby, basketball, or wrestling, the majority of sports jerseys on the market today are made from some form of synthetic mesh fabric. This fabric's high breathability also makes it a top pick outside of the world of team sports. It's common to see people wearing synthetic mesh clothing to the gym, and these garments are often branded by leading athletic wear corporations like Nike and Adidas. Due to its elasticity, however, mesh fabric is also commonly used to make a type of apparel called shapewear. This type of apparel is commonly used by women to alter the shapes of their bodies. It can be used to conceal fat, for instance, and it can also raise breasts or tighten abdomens. In addition, this type of fabric is used in various types of lingerie, and it is also popular for industrial applications such as netting and screen printing tools. Where Is Mesh Fabric Produced? This type of fabric was originally produced in Aertex production facilities in the United Kingdom. As this fabric became more popular in the mid-1980s, other production facilities were opened in the United States and other nations, and the USA and UK remained the main producers of this fabric until the waning decades of the 20th century. During the last few decades, China has supplanted the Western nations as the preeminent supplier of most types of textiles. Whether it's silk, cotton, rayon, or ","64 polyester, companies in China contribute more fabrics to the global consumer economy than the factories of any other nation. At the same time, other Asian nations, such as India, Pakistan, and Indonesia, have also become significant textile suppliers. Most of the world's polyester and nylon, which are the two fabrics most commonly used to make mesh, is produced in China, but a booming economy and relaxed regulations have recently driven the return of textile manufacturing to the United States. While it's likely that China will remain the world's leading supplier of mesh fabric for the foreseeable future, the polyester and nylon production arena is becoming increasingly competitive. How Much Does Mesh Fabric Cost? The price of mesh fabric depends both on the type of material that is used and the style of mesh that is woven. For instance, undyed mesh that is woven in a simple square pattern is relatively inexpensive, but brightly-dyed mesh that is woven in a hexagonal Tulle pattern costs more to make, so it is more expensive to garment producers and the end consumer. If a certain type of mesh, such as Tulle, is made from silk, it will cost more than mesh fabric made from a synthetic material. However, nylon and polyester are roughly equal in price. It's also important to remember that purchasing mesh fabric from a factory in a Western nation may cost more than buying mesh from China, India, Pakistan, or Indonesia. ","65 Different Types of Mesh Fabric: There are a few different types of mesh fabric, and there are also multiple terms that are used to refer to the same mesh fabric variant: • Polyester mesh: Most types of meshes used in sportswear and athletic apparel are made from polyester. This type of fabric is incredibly lightweight, and it has a noticeable ability to wick moisture. Unlike other types of fabric, polyester mesh does not get bogged down with sweat, and it is highly breathable. • Nylon mesh: One of the most iconic applications of nylon mesh is in beekeeping veils. This type of mesh is less commonly used to make apparel, and it is more frequently used to make items like tent screens and laundry bags. However, nylon mesh is sometimes used to make lightweight garments like evening dresses. • Tulle: This type of mesh is most frequently used in brightly-colored dance garments as an accent. In some cases, tulle may be made from silk, which mitigates the environmental impact of this type of mesh fabric. However, it's far more common to find tulle made from polyester or nylon, and this fabric is commonly bunched to generate a textured appearance. • Power mesh: Power mesh is known for its compression abilities, and it is commonly used in a variety of sportswear and shapewear garments. This type of fabric is also sometimes used in home decor due to its almost entirely sheer appearance. Power mesh is not a trademark of any corporation; on the contrary, it is simply a name given to a type of mesh that is more elastic and more suited for shapewear than normal nylon or polyester mesh. • Powernet: This type of mesh fabric features a relatively dense weave. Powernet is commonly used in shaping apparel such as top tights, bras, and control slips, and in ","66 some cases, the term \"powernet\" may be used interchangeably with \"power mesh.\" How Does Mesh Fabric Impact the Environment? The environmental impact of mesh fabric depends, to a degree, on the materials from which it is made. However, since this fabric is almost always made from synthetic materials, it's easy to say that mesh has a notably negative impact on the environment. Both nylon and polyester are fully synthetic materials that are derived from petroleum oil. This natural resource is called a fossil fuel because it is composed of decomposed animal matter from millions of years ago, and the world's stores of petroleum oil are not being regenerated. It is, therefore, an unsustainable resource, and since petroleum is also used to make important commodities like gasoline and engine oil, the wisdom of its use for fabric has been disputed by commentators at all ends of the political spectrum. It takes a great deal of energy and labor to procure petroleum oil, and once this material is obtained, more energy and labor are expended to render it into fabric filaments. In the process of making both nylon and polyester, large volumes of water are used to cool these materials while they are in their molten form, and this contaminated water inevitably reenters the hydrosphere. In addition, the production of nylon requires a substance called adipic acid, and the manufacture of this chemical releases nitrous oxide into the atmosphere, which scientists have identified as being 300 times worse for the environment than CO2. The environmental issues associated with the production of petroleum-based fabrics are only one half of the story. Once these fabrics are sold on the consumer market, the only place where they can end up is in the ecosystem. Neither polyester or nylon biodegrade, which means that garments made from these fabrics could continue gumming up waterways and harming animals for thousands or millions of years. Even if these fabrics are disposed of properly, they will eventually reenter the ecosystem. There is no way to stop this pollution from occurring once polyester or nylon fabrics are made; the only way to reduce this effect is to produce fewer garments made with these fabrics ","67 Fleece Fabric What is Fleece? Fleece is a man-made wonder product, if there is such a thing. Despite being named after the ‘fleece’ coat on a sheep, it’s 100% synthetic and derived from plastic rather than a fluffy sheep’s coat – despite being fuzzy to the touch. The super soft, warm and breathable nature of this magic material makes it perfect for outerwear and all things cozy. What is Fleece Made From? Typically, this fabric is created from polyester (which comes from plastic). The fibers of polyester are woven into a light fabric which is brushed to help the fibers increase in volume. Occasionally other natural fibers are incorporated into the fleece such as wool, hemp or rayon to create a certain texture or vibrancy of the fabric. It can also be made from recycled plastics such as plastic water bottles, giving it an eco-friendly edge whilst being inexpensive. How is Fleece Made? For polyester fleece, the polyester fibers need to be made first. This is created using a chemical reaction involving petroleum and petroleum derivatives. The chemicals are heated until they form a thick syrup, which then hardens and is spun to form threads. Because of the structure of the fibers, fleece is extremely warm and breathable and allows air to flow through it easily. ","68 Its Characteristics: The characteristics of this fabric make it incredibly useful for keeping warm, particularly whilst being active. Fleece has a pile surface on both sides of the fabric, meaning each side has a layer of cut fibers. Air pockets can sit between the threads in this pile surface, meaning the material can hold in that bit more warmth. Not only is polyester fleece warm and durable, but it is moisture resistant making it ideal for extreme weather conditions or for sportswear which it became popular for in the 1990s, due to it being warmer than wool and much lighter to wear. What is Fleece Used For? This fabric has been used for everything from ear-warmers for baby calves, to underwear for astronauts. Its versatility makes it one of the most commonly used fabrics in the textile industry today. As mentioned, fleece is the ideal material for athletic garments. The cloth wicks perspiration and moisture away from the body, keeping athletes dry, while letting air circulate through the fibers. It has also been known to keep odors from sweating at bay! The short pile fabric increases the body temperature when it’s against the skin, making fleece the go-to fabric for warming Winter garments. Coats, scarves, gloves, blankets are often made from this lovely cozy material to create long-lasting and extra warm Winter wear. ","69 Origins & History Fleece originated in the 1970s when Malden Mills developed polyester fleece, which was the basis on which all modern fleece was created. Malden Mills was previously known for producing faux fur and wool garments, and the company wanted to replicate the insulating nature of these fabrics without the issues that come with natural wool (e.g. being wet when heavy, and needing sheep to create it). Malden Mills partnered with outdoor clothing company Patagonia, together doubting Synchilla fleece – a strong, pile fabric made to imitate wool. The owner of Malden – Aaron Feuerstein – decided not to patent fleece, allowing it to be accessible to the masses and inexpensive to purchase. Now working under the name PolarTec, the company continues to make its famous fleece today. Fleece Vs Wool Generally, fleece is preferred over wool because it is softer and much lighter in weight. Some people also find themselves itchy when they wear wool, but this reaction is unlikely to happen with synthetic polyester. However, wool has the advantage of being totally natural and environmentally friendly, whereas fleece is only eco-friendly if produced from recycled plastics. Fleece: ● Softer than wool ● Lighter weight ● Does not insulate when wet ● Breathable ● Creates static so can attract lint and pet hair Wool: ● Can be itchy ● Natural, environmentally friendly ● Insulating even when wet ● Breathable Surprisingly, fleece often comes out on top, essentially being a lighter and more breathable version of wool, with all the warmth and comfort of a natural fabric ","70 Linen Fabric What Is Linen Fabric? Linen is a flax-based textile that is predominantly used for homeware applications. While linen is similar to cotton, it is made from fibers derived from the stems of the flax plant instead of the balls that grow around cotton seeds. Garments made of linen are desirable in hot and humid climates. Unlike cotton, which tends to retain moisture for a significant period of time, linen dries quickly, which helps reduce heat retention in overly warm conditions. Manufacturing linen, however, is much more time and resource-intensive than making cotton, which has led to a steady reduction in popularity of this fabric that began with the invention of the cotton gin. Nevertheless, the unique desirable attributes of linen have prevented the total cessation of global production of this textile, and certain countries, such as China, continue to make linen in reasonably large quantities. Before we proceed, it’s important to clarify the difference between the phrases “linen” and “linens.” While “linen” is used to refer to the flax-based fiber that is commonly used in homewares and certain forms of apparel, “linens” is a phrase that people use to refer to certain kinds of household items and apparel but may be made from fibers other than flax fiber. The phrase “linens” dates back to a time in which almost all underwear, bed sheets, and towels were made from linen, but these days, this anachronistic phrase can sometimes be confusing. ","71 History of Linen While evidence is scant from prehistoric times, it appears that Neolithic peoples in Europe were making textiles from linen as long as 36,000 years ago. Therefore, linen is one of the longest-produced textiles, and its history may stretch back even farther than the most ancient evidence that modern archaeology has uncovered. The next piece of historical evidence of linen use comes from ancient dwellings that were built on Switzerland’s lakefronts around 10,000 years ago, and according to archaeologists, linen was first domesticated in ancient Mesopotamia. While the use of linen for garments in Mesopotamia was mainly reserved for the ruling class, the use of linen in Ancient Egypt was much more widespread. Due to the Egyptian climate, it was necessary to devise apparel that resisted the sun’s rays and allowed rapid sweat cooling. Since linen is naturally white, this fabric was an obvious choice, and its breathability and lack of moisture retention rapidly caused it to become the most popular and valuable textile in Egypt. In fact, the Ancient Egyptians sometimes used linen as a bonafide type of currency. This fabric was also used to make the burial shrouds and wrappings for mummies. The Ancient Greeks used linen to make garments and homewares, and the Phoenicians later introduced linen production to Western Europe. However, historical records suggest that there was no effort on behalf of European powers to ","72 regulate flax production among farming communities until the 12th century AD. Later, Ireland became the center of European linen production, and by the 18th century, the town of Belfast became known as “Linenopolis” because of its thriving line trade. Linen remained popular throughout the colonial era, but as cotton production became cheaper and easier, the central role that linen used to hold within Europe’s textile economy gradually diminished. Linen Today These days, linen is primarily a niche product that remains in production to manufacture a handful of textile products. Despite its rich history, linen is no longer in vogue due to the laborious and time-intensive processes used to make this fabric. Ironically, production difficulties originally disincentivized linen production thousands of years ago; while the challenges facing line producers today are quite different than they were in antiquity, this fabric remains finicky and expensive to produce. How Is Linen Fabric Made? The constituent material for linen fabric is the cellulose fiber found in the stems of linen plants. Like the stalks of many similar plants, linen stalks consist of a woody, reedy interior section and a fibrous, stringy exterior section. To prepare for linen production, manufacturers of this fiber start by separating flax fibers from the woody interior of flax stems. Traditionally, this step has been accomplished by soaking raw flax stalks, but these days, manufacturers may use chemicals to achieve the same effect. Before flax fibers are spun into yarn, these chemicals are washed away, but residual toxic substances may remain on chemically-separated flax fiber. ● Planting: Flax plants are ready for harvesting after about 100 days of growth. Since flax plants do not tolerate heat, they must be planted in the cooler part of the year to avoid crop death. ● Growth: These days, flax seeds are usually sown with machines. Since flax plants don’t effectively prevent the incursion of weeds, herbicides and tilling are generally used to prevent reduced yields in flax crops. ● Harvesting: Once flax stems are yellow and their seeds are brown, these ","73 plants are ready to be harvested. While it’s possible to harvest flax by hand, machines are usually used for this process. ● Fiber Separation: After flax stalks are harvested, they are processed through a machine that removes leaves and seeds. Then, manufacturers separate flax’s fibrous outer stalk from its soft, woody interior. This process is called retting, and unless it is expertly accomplished, the delicate flax fibers used for textile production could be damaged. ● Breaking: Next, the decomposed stalks are broken up, which separates the unusable outer fibers of flax stalks from their usable inner fibers. To accomplish this step, the flax stalks are sent through rollers that crush them, and then rotating paddles remove the outer fibers from the stalks. ● Combining: Now that the inner fibers are separated from the other fibers, they can be combed into thin strands. Once the fibers have been combed, they will be ready for spinning. ● Spinning: Spinning of flax yarn used to be accomplished with a foot-powered flax wheel, but these days, flax producers use industrial machines for this process. To spin flax fibers, these short, combed fibers are connected with devices called spreaders, and the resulting strings, called rovings, are then ready to be spun. ● Reeling: After being spun on a spinning frame, the resulting yarn is reeled onto a bobbin. To ensure that flax yarn won’t fall apart, it’s necessary to perform this reeling process in wet, humid conditions, and the spun yarn is run through a hot water bath to further ensure yarn cohesion. ● Drying: Finally, flax manufacturers dry the finished yarn and reel it onto bobbins. The yarn is then ready to be dyed, treated, and made into apparel, homewares, or other types of textile products. How Is Linen Fabric Used? Historically, linen was one of the world’s most popular textile products. From Ancient Egypt to Renaissance Ireland, many cultures used linen as their predominant source of apparel and homeware fiber. These days, linen is used for many of the same purposes that it was used historically, but this fiber makes up a drastically smaller percentage of the global textile market. Additionally, many of the original applications of linen, such as shirts and pants, have largely been replaced with cotton. ","74 In hot climates, however, linen is still used to produce everyday clothing in large quantities. People living near equatorial regions can benefit from linen’s high moisture-wicking but low moisture-retaining profile, and the natural white color of this fabric inherently reflects heat-inducing solar rays. Manufacturers can use linen to make practically anything commonly made from cotton or wool. For instance, this fabric can be used to make shirts, pants, dresses, skirts, jackets, blazers, vests, and a wide variety of other casual and formal wear. Additionally, linen is still a popular material for lingerie and underwear, and it’s also commonly used in nightgowns and dressing robes. Outside the realm of apparel, linen remains popular as a homeware material. It’s especially common to find napkins and tablecloths made from linen, and while cotton is more popular for towels these days, it’s also possible to find hand towels, kitchen towels, and bath towels made from linen. Bedding is another arena in which cotton has all-but supplanted linen, but it’s still possible to find linen pillowcases and sheets. One advantage of linen in bedding is this textile’s durability; it’s possible to achieve higher thread counts in linen than in cotton without encountering durability issues. One of the lone industrial applications of linen is in the production of canvases for painting. Where Is Linen Fabric Produced? As with most textiles, China is currently the largest producer of linen. However, the production of high-quality linen products remains an important part of the cultures of many European countries, and Ireland, Italy, and Belgium remain significant linen producers. Linen used predominantly for homewares is also produced in the United States in relatively large quantities. How Much Does Linen Fabric Cost? Data on the price of unprocessed linen yarn per pound are not available, but prices of woven linen fabric fluctuate between $5 and $12 per yard. At these prices, linen is one of the most expensive natural fibers in the world, but it is incontestable that linen remains highly in demand for specific niche applications. ","75 What Different Types of Linen Fabric Are There? While all types of linen fabric are derived from processed and spun flax fiber, there are four main variations in weaving techniques that result in different types of linen fabric: 1. Damask linen: This type of linen is ornate and delicate, and it is formed on a jacquard loom to produce an end result that’s similar to embroidery. Damask linen isn’t designed for everyday use, and it’s more common in decorative items. 2. Plain-woven linen: Plain-woven linen is commonly used to make dish towels, cotton towels, and hand towels. Since it is relatively loosely-woven, it is highly durable, but it doesn’t suffer from a significant decrease in durability. 3. Loosely-woven linen: Loosely-woven linen is highly absorbent, but it is the least- durable type of linen fabric. It is commonly used to make reusable diapers and sanitary napkins. 4. Sheeting linen: Linen apparel is usually made from sheeting linen due to its untextured, soft surface and close weave. This type of linen usually has a higher thread count than other forms of linen fabric. How Does Linen Fabric Impact the Environment? The main environmental concern regarding linen production is the release of chemicals used in the retting process into surrounding ecosystems. Most commonly, alkali or oxalic acid are used to separate flax fibers from the woody interior of flax stems, and while chemical retting of flax is undeniably faster and more efficient, both alkali and oxalic acid are toxic in relatively low concentrations. Therefore, water retting of flax stems is preferred for environmental reasons, and to be certified as organic, it’s generally necessary for flax fiber to be water-retted. Since flax is already such an expensive fiber, however, water retting simply compounds this increased cost to make organic flax less accessible to most consumers. In addition to concerns over the release of toxic chemicals into the environment, there may also be land use concerns over flax production. Specifically, most ","76 cultivation processes used to grow flax degrade soil, which can lead to soil erosion and expansion of agricultural lands into neighboring wilderness areas. Furthermore, most textile production around the world is inhumane. The vast majority of textile workers are essentially slave laborers who are forced to endure horrific working conditions for insufficient pay. As a result, the ability of linen workers to contribute to local economies is diminished, and stewardship of the land takes a backseat to the pressing day-to-day struggle to survive. Overall, however, linen is one of the least environmentally damaging textiles. Unlike synthetic textiles, natural fabrics like linen are biodegradable, which means that their constituent molecules reabsorb into the surrounding environment within a matter of years instead of centuries. Natural fibers also don’t contribute to the ongoing microfiber pollution crisis in the hydrosphere, which threatens aquatic and human life. If linen is cultivated in accordance with proper stewardship of the land, it is not environmentally harmful. To meet the global demand for linen products without incurring prohibitive overhead costs, however, the majority of linen producers choose to use inexpensive processes that may be environmentally damaging. ","77 eVent Fabric What is eVent fabric? eVent is a waterproof fabric made by eVent Fabrics. As an expanded polytetrafluorethylene (ePTFE) fabric, eVent is in direct competition with GORE-TEX, the legally acknowledged inventor of ePTFE. While eVent is highly similar to GORE-TEX in many ways, this fabric features proprietary Direct Venting technology, which increases breathability and reduces the possibility of overheating. Largely due to aggressive measures taken by GORE- TEX, eVent has never reached an y particularly notable degree of popularity, but this fabric remains available in a variety of different forms, and it’s featured in products made by Eddie Bauer and a handful of other internationally renowned brands. eVent fabric technical specifications eVent has a water column (hydrostatic head) rating of 30,000mm, making it slightly ","78 more waterproof than GORE-TEX, which has a water column rating of 28,000mm. This fabric has an MTVR breathability rating of 15,000 - 25,000 g/m2/24, making it competitive with NeoShell, which is widely considered to be one of the most breathable waterproof fabrics. Therefore, eVent offers the best of both worlds, and its increased breathability is directly attributable to Direct Venting technology. GORE-TEX, which features an ePTFE membrane attached to polyurethane (PU), only becomes breathable once its PU membrane has become exposed to moisture. When dry, GORE-TEX has almost no breathability, and it is very easy to overheat when wearing GORE-TEX jackets or pants in dry conditions. As a result, many outdoors enthusiasts stash away their waterproof garments featuring GORE-TEX or a similar material until the weather becomes wet, which is inefficient and takes up precious backpack space. Outerwear featuring eVent, however, is designed to be breathable and comfortable regardless of whether outdoor conditions are dry or wet. eVent claims that its Direct Venting technology makes it easier for you to stay in the “dry zone,” which is an ideal state of temperature and humidity that your body tries to maintain while you are engaged in physical exertion. At the hot extreme of the dry zone, you overheat since the sweat your body uses to stay cool remains trapped within your apparel, and at the cold extreme of the dry zone, the layer of sweat covering your body causes you to become unreasonably cold. By keeping you dry via proper evaporation through its membrane, eVent fabric keeps you from becoming uncomfortably hot or cold while exerting yourself. While eVent fabric is more breathable than GORE-TEX, its lack of a protective polyurethane layer means that it is more temperamental than PU-based waterproof fabrics. To remain effective, it is necessary to wash eVent fabrics frequently and regularly treat them with durable water repellent (DWR) spray. These negative factors prevent eVent fabric from being clearly superior to GORE-TEX. History of eVent fabric eVent fabric was first announced in 1999. The eVent Fabrics corporation was specifically founded to produce the eVent membrane, and while multiple new forms ","79 of eVent have been produced over the years, this company has not expanded into any other product categories. Immediately met with accolades for its enhanced breathability and powerful waterproofing properties, eVent rapidly became a major competitor of GORE-TEX. The W.L. Gore corporation, however, is not fond of competition, and according to some sources, this inventor of GORE-TEX took aggressive action to limit the distribution of eVent. Combined with the undesirably temperamental attributes of this PU-free waterproofing material, competition with W.L. Gore has significantly reduced the potential reach of eVent. This fabric remains less popular than GORE-TEX, which pioneered the breathable fabric industry, and other major competitors like OutDry and NeoShell, which are propped up by the major outdoor apparel companies Columbia Sportswear and Polartec respectively. eVent fabric today Regardless of its comparatively low popularity, eVent has received a number of accolades over the years, and some outdoor enthusiasts swear by this fabric’s desirable combination of breathability and competitive waterproofing. As a result, eVent Fabrics has been able to regularly roll out new textile products. This company maintains exclusive contracts with a variety of notable brands, and it produces professional wear for industrial and military applications. Based on its current presence in the market, eVent appears to have less reach than ever before, but there have been no signs of financial instability within eVent Fabrics, and this company continues to regularly release new innovations. ","80 How is eVent fabric made? eVent Fabrics has not released exact details regarding the methods it uses to produce its flagship product, but based on the information available, it’s possible to make some basic assumptions regarding the eVent production process: 1. ePTFE membrane production: The eVent production process begins with the manufacturing of ePTFE, which is accomplished by rapidly stretching solid blocks of PTFE that have been heated to high temperatures. The resulting substance is remarkably porous while preventing the passage of water droplets. 2. Combination with outdoor apparel material: Next, bulk quantities of eVent fabric are either sent to sportswear brands for incorporation into finished products or eVent Fabrics combines this material with popular types of outerwear fabric in its own manufacturing facilities. In either case, the eVent fabric is applied directly to the inside of a suitable textile material such as nylon. 3. Initial DWR treatment: After being cut and sewn into a piece of sportswear apparel, eVent fabric receives its first DWR treatment, which will keep the apparel waterproof and breathable for up to five years. To make DWR treatment last longer, it’s necessary to remove oils from eVent fabric by washing it regularly. How is eVent fabric used? eVent fabric is primarily used in outdoor apparel, but this fabric is also found in a variety of types of outdoor gear and accessories. Most commonly used in lightweight rain shells, eVent fabric is sometimes included in heavier jackets, overalls, and pants. eVent Fabrics produces a few specialized types of eVent designed for use in footwear, and variations of this fabric are sometimes used to make waterproof gloves or tents. eVent is also occasionally used to produce dry sacks, which are used to keep items dry in marine applications. Where is eVent fabric produced? eVent Fabrics is based in Los Angeles, and based on the information this company has made public, it continues to produce its products in the United States. ","81 How much does eVent fabric cost? eVent fabric is usually comparatively priced with GORE-TEX and other ePTFE-based waterproof fabrics. Certain types of eVent, however, may be more expensive since they are designed for advanced or niche applications. What different types of eVent fabric are there? eVent Fabrics produces a variety of different types of its flagship textile material, and there are also a few key competitors of eVent that should be kept in mind: 1. DVexpedition: While eVent Fabrics now produces a wide range of products, this company continues to focus heavily on its line of waterproof textiles. DVexpedition is the newest addition to eVent’s waterproof fabric family, and it offers enhanced waterproofing for advanced applications. Highly similar to the original textile produced by eVent Fabrics, DVexpedition has a 30,000mm water column and a breathability rating of 10,000g/m2. 2. DValpine: Based on the original eVent fabric, DVapline has a 20,000mm water column and offers 20,000g/m2 in breathability. This fabric is designed for medium- intensity outdoor activities such as hiking, backpacking, fishing, and snow sports. DValpine features a three-layer laminate that provides maximum breathability and waterproofing under most conditions. 3. DVstorm:Featuring an ultra-sheer, 10 denier backer and offering a 10,000mm water column, DVstorm combines comfort and moderate waterproofing by offering a breathability rating of 30,000g/m2. Advertised as being 20% lighter than DValpine, DVstorm is designed for high-intensity outdoor activities performed in moderate weather conditions. Due to its enhanced breathability, DVstorm apparel may be comfortable to wear even when outdoor conditions are dry. 4. DVwind:In addition to its waterproof offerings, eVent Fabrics also produces a line of windproof textiles designed for cycling and other intensive outdoor activities performed in high-wind conditions. DVwind blocks 99.6% of wind, and it offers 18,000g/m2 in air permeability. 5. DVstretch:DVstretch offers the same benefits as DVwind while also being highly ","82 elastic. eVent Fabrics creates DVstretch by combining ePTFE with a special elastic fabric called ITTTAI that is made in Italy. DVstretch is primarily used to make cycling suits, which are usually designed to be skintight. 6. Professional equipment fabrics:eVent Fabrics custom-produces a variety of high- performance textiles for military and first responder organizations. This company also offers a type of fabric called DVelite for professional applications such as fishing and construction, and DVshield is a professional, windproof fabric commonly used in tactical and workwear applications. 7. Footwear fabrics:eVent Fabrics offers three separate products for footwear. DVdry is applied to footwear using either booties or gasket technology, and it offers the same benefits as DValpine. DVdryLT is a new version of DVdry that offers the same enhanced protection as DVexpedition. In addition, eVent Fabrics produces professional footwear fabrics designed for use in workwear, first responder, and military applications. 8. GORE-TEX: The primary competitor of eVent Fabrics is W.L. Gore and Associates, the producer of GORE-TEX. Like eVent Fabrics, W.L. Gore produces a variety of textile products, and many of these textiles have similar properties to the products offered by eVent. Directly comparing the flagship fabrics produced by each company, eVent offers better breathability and slightly better waterproofing while GORE-TEX is more durable. How does eVent fabric impact the environment? PTFE is a significant environmental toxin, and ePTFE is no less toxic than its source material. This substance is not biodegradable, and when it is discarded, it can release contaminants into soil that hinder plant growth. PTFE also generally contributes to plastic pollution. In addition to posing environmental concerns, PTFE is toxic to human beings. Workers exposed to PTFE gas or powder during the process of producing this plastic can develop a condition called polymer fume fever, suggesting that PTFE may remain toxic post-production. A reasonably large percentage of new PTFE is unusable and is discarded, and it is very costly to recycle this substance. To remain effective, it is necessary to spray PTFE fabrics such as eVent with DWR regularly, and this substance may be harmful enough to cause toxicity concerns upon making contact with human skin. ","83 Angora Wool Fabric What is Angora wool fabric? Angora wool is a type of wool derived from the coats of Angora rabbits. While this luxurious fiber has come under fire in recent years due to the mistreatment of Angora rabbits, it is entirely possible to produce Angora wool in an ethical, sustainable way that does not involve cruelty to animals. At 12-16 microns, Angora wool fibers are among the finest types of wool fibers in the world, and as a result, Angora wool is remarkably silky and soft. This type of wool is impressively fluffy, and since the cores of Angora rabbit hairs are hollow, Angora wool has better heat retention qualities than most types of wool. Additionally, Angora wool does not have the allergenic properties inherent to other types of wool, making this fiber an essential alternative for people with animal hair allergies. ","84 History of Angora wool The city of Ankara in Turkey was once known in Europe as Angora, and Angora rabbits were first bred in this Anatolian metropolis. It’s unclear exactly when Angora rabbits were first bred, but by the 18th century, these profoundly fluffy rabbits had spread throughout Europe. First brought to France in 1723, Angora rabbits quickly became beloved among the French nobility, and the Angora fad quickly spread throughout the entire European aristocracy. At this time, Angora rabbits were not primarily used for wool production. Instead, they served as pets, often for children, who were enraptured by their incredibly voluminous and fluffy coats. The first records of large-scale Angora wool production date back to the early 20th century in the United States. American entrepreneurs, viewing Angora wool as more than just decorative, quickly established businesses producing Angora wool scarves, sweaters, and other items. Angora wool today There are quite a few varieties of Angora rabbits, and many of these subspecies originated before Angoras were exported to the United States. Perhaps most iconic is the English Angora, which grows thick, fluffy hair on every conceivable surface and looks like a twitching, fluffy ball prior to shearing. French Angoras have it slightly easier since their faces do not grow thick fur, but they also produce significantly less wool. Giant Angoras are, unsurprisingly, quite large, and they produce prodigious amounts of wool at the cost of being as large as house cats. While Satin Angoras produce the least wool of any Angora variety, their fur fibers are the thinnest and softest. Angora fur tends to mat, which can lead to irritation or even infection since these ","85 rabbits have such soft skin. Traditionally, Angora rabbits were generally well cared for, but accompanying the Chinese textile boom that has occurred over the last few decades, Angora rabbit maltreatment has become common, leading to backlash from animal rights organizations. It remains possible to find Angora wool that was produced humanely, but the actions of unethical Chinese manufacturers have perhaps irrevocably tarnished the name of this undeniably luxurious fabric. How is Angora wool fabric made? At its best, the production of Angora wool consists of a respectful, sustainable relationship between human and rabbit. The Angora wool production process involves a few distinct steps: 1. Cultivation of Angora fur: Most breeds of Angora rabbits produce full coats of fur within 3-4 months. During this time, Angora rabbits are kept comfortable and routinely groomed to prevent the formation of mats. The state at which an Angora’s coat is considered to be harvestable depends on the type of rabbit. 2. Shearing or “plucking”: Some types of Angora rabbits naturally start shedding their fur after around 4-5 months. Expert Angora breeders watch for telltale signs that a new coat of fur is about to come in, and they harvest the old fur before it falls off. While a somewhat unfortunate choice of words, the process of removing Angora fur that is about to be shed is called “plucking.” In some cases, this process can be just what it sounds like: inhumane and barbaric. Respectful and ethical Angora breeders, however, gently pull the loose hair away ","86 from the rabbit without inflicting any pain. Some Angora breeds do not shed as frequently, and some Angora breeders want to harvest fur more frequently. In these cases, Angora breeders carefully shear their rabbits. Ethical breeders observe respectful shearing protocols such as using blunt- tipped scissors and not shearing fur too close to the skin. 3. Sorting and cleaning: Once an Angora rabbit’s coat has been removed, Angora producers sort through the hair fibers to remove mats and other coarse materials such as guard hairs. In some cases, Angora fur is also separated into grades based on softness. Angora fur is generally washed before spinning. 4. Spinning and dyeing: Washed Angora fur is then spun into yarn. Angora fur is naturally white, cream-colored, or light-brown, but it’s also possible to dye this luxurious wool fiber. How is Angora wool fabric used? Angora wool is primarily used as an apparel material. First popularized as a sweater fabric, this type of wool is also used to make pea coats, suit jackets, scarves, gloves, and a variety of other apparel items. More rarely, Angora wool may also be used to make small throw blankets or pillow covers. Angora wool is also a very popular craft item used for knitting. Where is Angora wool fabric produced? Today, the majority of Angora wool remains produced in China. Despite the best efforts of the international animal rights community, factory farms in China continue to produce thousands of tons of Angora wool per year, and in almost every case, Chinese textile manufacturers use cruel and inhumane practices to produce this luxury fabric. Apparel producers concerned over the practices employed by Chinese Angora producers can source their Angora wool from the United States or other Western countries that do not commonly engage in animal cruelty. ","87 How much does Angora wool fabric cost? Angora wool is one of the most expensive natural textile fibers. A single ounce of Angora wool can cost as much as £15, and garments made with this fabric are correspondingly expensive. Textile manufacturers seeking to avoid associations with animal cruelty may need to pay even more for their Angora wool. While Chinese Angora wool producers commonly offer their wares for lower prices, these reduced prices are usually reflective of inhumane and unethical production processes. As a general rule, Angora wool that costs more is also more likely to be produced ethically. What different types of Angora wool fabric are there? There are a few different types of Angora wool, and there are also similar types of wool that are commonly confused with Angora. Here are a few examples: 1. Angora wool: While each breed of Angora rabbit produces fur with unique attributes, these distinctions generally become less noticeable once the fur has been spun into wool and woven into fabric. Fur from English Angora rabbits, for instance, is practically indistinguishable from fur from French Angora rabbits despite the fact that these animals look considerably different. Even wool from Giant, German, or Korean Angora rabbits looks and feels essentially the same as wool produced by more popular Angora breeds. 2. Satin Angora wool: Wool produced by Satin Angora rabbits, however, is considerably distinct from wool produced by other Angora breeds. Since it consists of fibers that can be as small as 12 microns in width, Satin Angora wool is remarkably soft and silky. Its fibers are so small, however, that Satin Angora wool can be slightly less fluffy than other Angora wool varieties. Since Satin Angora rabbits produce considerably less wool than other varieties, Satin Angora wool is usually more expensive than wool derived from other Angora breeds. 3. Mohair wool: Mohair wool is not derived from rabbits. Somewhat confusingly, however, this type of wool is derived from another type of animal with “Angora” in its name: Angora goats. Also hailing from the Turkish city of Ankara, Angora goats are ","88 covered with long, shaggy hair, and they are believed to have originally evolved in Tibet. Shiny and lustrous while being significantly coarser than Angora wool, mohair wool is another type of fabric that has ended up in the crosshairs of the animal rights advocacy movement due to the commonly inhumane treatment of Angora goats. 4. Cashmere wool: Named for the Indian region of Kashmir, cashmere wool is derived from a unique species of goat native to the area. Cashmere wool fibers can be as thin as 18 microns, but they are still considerably thicker than Angora wool fibers. Regardless, cashmere is considered to be one of the most luxurious types of wool due to its softness, and the cost of cashmere wool is further increased by the fact that cashmere goats only produce a small amount of hair per year. How does Angora wool fabric impact the environment? Since production of Angora wool only constitutes a tiny fraction of overall textile production worldwide, the environmental impact of this fabric is essentially negligible. Coupled with the fact that wool is an inherently biodegradable fabric, Angora wool only harms the environment inasmuch as animal waste might be improperly disposed of or incorrect housing of Angora rabbits could lead to soil erosion. The main issue posed by the Angora wool industry is ethical, not environmental. While properly taking care of Angora rabbits is a simple task, unethical Chinese wool manufacturers use barbaric methods to produce the greatest amount of Angora wool at the lowest possible cost. As a result, they commonly keep Angora rabbits in small, dirty cages, do not perform proper grooming, and subject their rabbits to malnutrition. Additionally, Chinese Angora producers commonly shear their rabbits close to the skin, causing infections, and they may suspend their rabbits by their paws during the shearing process or forcibly immobilize them, causing extreme pain. Animal rights activists are right to decry the Chinese Angora industry, but breeders in other parts of the world most commonly treat their rabbits with care and respect. ","89 Viscose Fabric Viscose fabric is durable and soft to the touch, and it's one of the world's most beloved textiles. But what exactly is viscose fabric, and how is it produced and used? What Is Viscose? Viscose, which is also commonly known as rayon when it is made into a fabric, is a type of semi-synthetic fabric. The name of this substance comes from the process that's used to make it; at one stage, rayon is a viscous, honey-like liquid that later settles into a solid form. The primary ingredient of rayon is wood pulp, but this organic ingredient goes through a lengthy production process before it becomes a wearable fabric. Because of these attributes, it's hard to determine whether rayon is a synthetic or natural fabric; while its source material is organic, the process this organic material is subjected to is so strenuous that the result is essentially a synthetic substance. ","90 How Is Viscose Fabric Made? Other types of rayon-like fabric require lignin-free cellulose as a starting material, but this type of fabric can be made with cellulose from wood pulp. This method of manufacturing rayon is much cheaper than many alternatives, and rayon made with this process can be manufactured on a large scale. 1. Cellulose extraction: The rayon production process begins with the creation of wood pulp cellulose. To create quality fabric, the cellulose used should be at least 90 percent pure. 2. Alkali cellulose conversion: This cellulose is then dissolved in caustic soda, which produces a chemical reaction that converts cellulose to alkali cellulose. This process removes impurities from the cellulose and prepares it for the next step of the manufacturing process. 3. Pressing: The alkali cellulose is then pressed between two rollers, which removes excess liquid. These pressed sheets are then shredded and crumbled into a substance called \"white crumb.\" 4. Aging and xanthation: The white crumb is then aged via exposure to pure oxygen, and next, it is exposed to carbon disulphide to make a new substance called \"yellow crumb.\" 5. Ripening: The yellow crumb is then dissolved and allowed to \"ripen\" for a period of a few hours. 6. Filtering and extruding: After it has ripened, the yellow crumb is filtered, and any gas bubbles are removed. Next, it is extruded through a spinneret, which is a device with many holes like a showerhead. 7. Acid bath and completion: Finally, the resulting substance is immersed in a bath of sulfuric acid, which results in rayon filaments. Thee filaments are then spun, drawn, and washed to produce a fabric that can then be cut to a desired shape and size. ","91 How Is This Fabric Used? Rayon is commonly used as a substitute for cotton. This fabric shares many traits with cotton, but in some cases, it may be easier or cheaper to produce. Most consumers can't tell the difference between cotton and rayon by touch, and since this fabric is made from organic materials, it is sometimes seen as superior to fully synthetic fabrics such as polyester. This fabric is used for most applications for which cotton is used. Whether it's dresses, shirts, or pants, rayon is used to make a wide variety of different articles of clothing, and this fabric may also be used to make household items like towels, washcloths, or tablecloths. Rayon is also sometimes used in industrial applications. Some business owners feel that rayon is a cheap and durable alternative to cotton. For instance, rayon has taken the place of cotton fibers in many types of tires and automotive belts. The type of rayon that is used in these applications is significantly stronger and more elastic than the type of rayon that is used for clothing. In addition, it's important to point out that rayon was originally developed as an alternative to silk. Over the years, consumers have accepted that rayon does not have all of the beneficial qualities of silk, and rayon manufacturers now predominantly produce rayon as a cotton substitute. However, some companies may still produce rayon as a substitute for silk, and it's relatively common to see scarves, shawls, and nightgowns that are made from this light and soft fabric. Where Is This Fabric Produced? Rayon is predominantly produced in large-scale factory settings. The rayon production process is too complex to be attempted in a small business setting; to make this fabric, it's necessary to have dozens of different types of chemicals and textile manufacturing machines. In most cases, rayon is made in large factories where other types of textiles are also made. While most of the world's rayon used to be made in the United States and the United Kingdom, production of this fabric has largely moved overseas. These days, most rayon is made in countries like India, Pakistan, Indonesia, and China. ","92 In these developing countries, labor is cheap, and manufacturing regulations are non-existent or not enforced. These factors give rayon manufacturers leeway to generate more profit without having to absorb the high level of overhead that is a necessary aspect of operating in first-world countries. In many cases, raw rayon is made into a final product in the same facility where it was produced or in a nearby facility. However, some rayon manufacturers may prefer to ship their raw product overseas to have it made into clothing, household textiles, or another type of product. What Are the Characteristics of Viscose? Viscose is a great option if you’re looking for a lightweight material with a nice drape, a lustrous finish, and a soft feel. It is relatively inexpensive and can convey luxury for a much lower price point. It also blends well with other fibers like cotton, polyester, and spandex. ● Absorbent. Viscose rayon does not trap heat, but it also absorbs water and sweat nicely, making it great for t-shirts and athletic wear. ● Lightweight. Viscose is extremely airy, which makes it nice for blouses and summer dresses. ● Breathable. It’s a very light fabric that doesn’t stick to the body, so it’s optimal for warm weather clothing. ● Soft. While the material looks like silk, it feels like cotton. ● Maintains Shape. The fabric is not elastic but can be blended with other textiles, such as spandex, to add stretch. ● Dye fast. Viscose can hold dye without fading, even after long-term use and washes. 3 Environmental Considerations in Viscose Fabric Production When considering sustainability, viscose is not an environmentally friendly option, due to water waste in the production process, saturation of chemicals, and destruction of local ecosystems. Here are some things to consider before choosing to purchase viscose: ● Deforestation. While the wood to make viscose can be sustainably harvested, it often does not come from sustainably-grown forests, wiping out large ","93 natural forests and negatively impacting local ecosystems. ● Toxic chemicals. The production of viscose uses a high concentration of toxic chemicals that pollute the air and water. Sulfur, nitrous oxides, carbon, disulfide, and hydrogen sulfide are found in air emissions around viscose manufacturing sites. Although the chemicals can be reused across the production cycle, it is not a perfect process, and production for other types of rayon, like modal, tencel, and lyocell, are cleaner. ● Water waste. Viscose production uses a lot of water, both in watering the trees and in the process of turning those trees into fabric. Viscose is biodegradable and made from a renewable resource, however, though the environmental impact of producing viscose is still high. What Is the Difference Between Viscose and Polyester? While many consider the viscose and polyester to be similar, there are a lot of differences between the two materials. ● Both polyester and rayon are made from long fibers, but polyester is a synthetic fiber, whereas viscose is semi-synthetic, i.e. using natural fibers but chemicals in the process ● Polyester is more moisture-wicking while viscose is more absorbent. ● Polyester dries faster and does not wrinkle as easily as viscose. ● Polyester is stronger and does not shrink. ● Viscose is more likely to pill, whereas polyester resists abrasion. ● Polyester is made from oil while viscose is made from plants. What Is the Difference Between Viscose and Modal? Modal is what’s called a “high wet modulus rayon,” which means it’s a type of rayon that’s stronger when wet and doesn’t lose its shape, which is not true for viscose. The production process for modal is almost exactly the same as that for viscose, but the fibers used in modal undergo more processing which makes the final product stronger, lighter, and more breathable. Modal is more environmentally friendly than viscose because lower concentrations of sodium hydroxide are used to make it. ","94 Faux Fur/ Fake Fur, Real Fur & Differences: Materials, Textures, etc What is faux fur? And more specifically, what is faux fur fabric? As a wholesaler of faux fur fabric, we get asked this question on a regular basis. But before we dive into what faux fur fabric is, let’s be clear: our faux fur is free from animal products, and no animals were harmed in the production of our faux fur. Let’s define what faux fur is. Faux fur is literally exactly what it sounds like — it’s fake fur. It’s generally a knitted, synthetic fabric made from a blend of acrylic and polyester fibers that’s available in virtually endless colors and patterns, and different weights and pile heights. So, if you’re looking for a bright pink, luxury shag fur, we have you covered. Whenever you see someone in public wearing a leopard fur jacket or a fur vest, chances are it’s faux fur. It’s as soft and cozy as it looks, and with a variety of textures and pile heights, it’s a fabric you truly have to feel in person to understand completely (we know, we’re a tad biased). It’s good for more than just accessories and apparel — faux fur is a surprisingly ","95 versatile fabric and can be used in ways you may not expect. We’ll mention some fun faux fur sewing projects in more detail below, but for now, let’s dig into our “what is faux fur?” question a bit further. Faux fur is most commonly found as a knitted, synthetic fabric that is made from a blend of acrylic and polyester fibers. Note its construction can vary though, as faux fur can be made by other techniques such as weaving or tufting, and can be infused with other materials like wool or cotton. Faux fur is also generally manufactured with the plush “fur” on one side of the fabric, and a smooth synthetic backing (base) on the other. This common one-sided technique is available in a wide range of pile heights and weights, with “pile height” essentially referring to how long the fur on top is. Faux fur colors and textures For the sake of simplicity, let’s take a closer look at the 80/20 blend faux furs. Because this type of faux fur is synthetic, it can be created in virtually any color and in a wide range of textures. Faux fur colors Color-wise, simple solid faux furs are the most popular variety, but faux fur is available in prints that contain multiple colors (and colors that aren’t found in nature), too. A testament to the technological advances in how faux fur is made, it can be almost impossible to tell the difference between faux fur and real fur, and this especially is the case with animal prints. You can now get the look of an authentic animal hide without harming any critters we adore so much. Faux fur textures In addition to colors, manufacturers are able to match a specific fur texture with impressive accuracy. We offer faux fur fabric that feels (and looks) like authentic yak fur, rabbit fur, leopard fur, alpaca fur, weasel fur, etc. These different types of faux fur ","96 textures are a great way to add depth for a more visually interesting sewing project. What is real fur? Real fur, also called genuine fur, is generally from foxes or rabbits, although lynxes, chinchillas and raccoons are also common animals raised for their fur. In order to keep production costs down, these animals are crammed into small cages with other animals, with disease, parasites and unbearably high levels of stress prevalent throughout the “farm” (the waste associated with these farms is highly toxic for the local environment, too). Over half of the world’s genuine fur comes from Europe, and most of these animals live painful, short lives. We’ll spare you the details on how they’re slaughtered, but as expected, it’s inhumane and disturbing. Once the fur is harvested, it’s treated with harmful chemicals to prevent decomposing before being used as trim, lining or as the main substrate of a piece. Accessories and garments with real fur can cost several thousands of dollars depending on the quality of the fur and how much fur is used. ","97 Cotton Fabric What Is Cotton Fabric? Cotton fabric is one of the most commonly used types of fabrics in the world. This textile is chemically organic, which means that it does not contain any synthetic compounds. Cotton fabric is derived from the fibers surrounding the seeds of cotton plants, which emerge in a round, fluffy formation once the seeds are mature. The earliest evidence for the use of cotton fibers in textiles is from the Mehrgarh and Rakhigarhi sites in India, which date to approximately 5000 BC. The Indus Valley Civilization, which spanned the Indian Subcontinent from 3300 to 1300 BC, was able to flourish due to cotton cultivation, which provided the people of this culture with readily available sources of clothing and other textiles. It’s possible that people in the Americas used cotton for textiles as long ago as 5500 BC, but it’s clear that cotton cultivation was widespread throughout Mesoamerica since at least 4200 BC. While the Ancient Chinese relied more on silk than cotton for the production of textiles, cotton cultivation was popular in China during the Han dynasty, which lasted from 206 BC to 220 AD. While cotton cultivation was widespread in both Arabia and Iran, this textile plant didn’t make its way to Europe in full force until the late Middle Ages. Before this point, Europeans believed that cotton grew on mysterious trees in India, and some scholars during this period even suggested that this textile was a type of wool that was produced by sheep that grew on trees. The Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, however, introduced Europeans to cotton production, and the European countries quickly became major producers and exporters of cotton along with Egypt and India. Since the earliest days of cotton cultivation, this fabric has been prized for its exceptional breathability and lightness. Cotton fabric is also incredibly soft, but it has heat retention attributes that make it something like a mixture of silk and wool. While cotton is more durable than silk, it is less durable than wool, and this fabric is relatively prone to pilling, rips, and tears. Nonetheless, cotton remains one of the most popular and highly produced fabrics in the world. This textile has relatively high ","98 tensile strength, and its natural coloring is white or slightly yellowish. Cotton is very water absorbent, but it also dries quickly, which makes it highly moisture wicking. You can wash cotton in high heat, and this fabric drapes well on your body. However, cotton fabric is relatively prone to wrinkling, and it will shrink when washed unless it is exposed to a pre-treatment. How Is Cotton Fabric Made? Cotton fabric producers derive this textile from the fibrous protective casing that surrounds cotton seeds, which is called a boll. While cotton seeds themselves are quite small, the bolls that encase them can be larger than the end of your thumb. To make cotton fabric, producers must first separate the cotton seed from the boll. In the past, this step was done by hand, but in 1794, American entrepreneur Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin, which is a mechanical device that greatly expedites the cotton separation process. These days, automated forms of the cotton gin exist that make the process even easier for human workers. Machines can harvest cotton bolls from agricultural fields, and other machines can then separate the seeds from the bolls. Cotton production begins in the spring when cotton seeds are planted. In most cases, automated machines plant cotton seeds in 10 or more rows simultaneously. Seedlings emerge within approximately seven days, and mature cotton bolls appear within 55 to 80 days. Prior to machine harvesting, human workers are generally required for defoliation, ","99 which is the process of removing the leaves from cotton plants. Next, a single machine harvests the amount of cotton that 50 people could pick, and this same machine removes large contaminants from the cotton fibers and forms it into bales. High-efficiency automated cotton gins can process up to 60 raw cotton bales weighing 500 pounds each in the space of an hour. These gins remove the seeds from cotton bolls, and they also remove any dirt or trash from the cotton. Once cotton has been cleaned to the extent that it consists of pure cotton fibers without any seeds or trash, it is transferred to a textile production facility. At this facility, the raw cotton is carded, which is the process of forming cotton fibers into long strands. Next, these strands are spun to create yarn. At this stage, the basic material used in cotton fabrics is complete. This cotton yarn may then be subjected to a variety of chemical treatments, and it may be dyed. Next, it is woven into a particular type of textile material such as a bedsheet, T-shirt, or pair of blue jeans. How Is Cotton Fabric Used? Approximately 75 percent of the world’s clothing products contain at least some amount of cotton. In sheer numbers, cotton is the most widely used textile fiber in the world, and manufacturers can spin this fabric into a myriad of different types of products. For instance, most T-shirts contain at least some amount of cotton, and true blue jeans are 100 percent cotton. This fabric is used to make bathrobes, bathmats, and towels, and it is also used to make bedsheets, blankets, and duvets. Manufacturers may even use cotton to make curtains, wall-hangings, and other types of home decorations. Since cotton is highly breathable and absorbent, it is commonly used to make warm-weather clothing. Its softness makes it a good option for formal and business wear, and its notable draping abilities make it an ideal fabric for dresses. Manufacturers use cotton to make medical supplies, and this fabric is also used to make industrial thread and tarps. In summation, cotton can be used to make ","100 practically any type of textile for consumer or industrial use. Where Is Cotton Fabric Produced? India and China are frequently tied as the largest cotton producers in the world. According to Statista, India overtook its East Asian competitor between 2017 and 2018 by producing 6,205,000 metric tons of cotton. For comparison, China produced 5,987,000 metric tons of cotton fiber during this same period. At 4,555,000 metric tons, the USA is the next-largest producer of cotton. While these three nations produce the vast majority of the world’s cotton, other nations, such as Brazil, Pakistan, and Australia consistently produce more than 1 million metric tons of this fiber per year. How Much Does Cotton Fabric Cost? According toIndexMundi, raw cotton costs approximately $0.75 per pound. However, these prices are subject to constant change. Cotton costs significantly more once a producer has formed it into yarn, and its price increases again once this fiber is made into a final product. Comparatively speaking, cotton is one of the least expensive textile fibers in the world, which has contributed to its popularity. However, the cheapest cotton is cotton that has not been produced sustainably, and better forms of cotton cost much more. For instance, forms of extra-long-staple cotton are significantly more expensive than traditional short-staple cotton. Examples of extra-long-staple cotton include Egyptian cotton and Pima cotton. These types of cotton cost more for manufacturers to produce, and they also cost more at the consumer level. What Different Types of Cotton Fabric Are There? There are four distinct species of cotton that are used to make cotton fabric. In ","101 addition, there are several sub-varieties of cotton fabric that are made from these plant species: Cotton Plant Varieties: 1. Gossypium hirsutum This type of cotton is the most widely-produced form of this textile crop. It accounts for 90 percent of the world’s cotton production, and it is native to Central America and the nations surrounding the Caribbean Sea. Over the years, traders have exported this type of cotton to practically every location throughout the world, and it grows well in practically any climate. Gossypium hirsutum is a short-staple (SS) cotton fiber, which means that it is not as high-quality as other forms of this textile fiber. 2. Gossypium barbadense Gossypium barbadense is an extra-long-staple (ELS) cotton variety, which means that it consists of longer cotton fibers that produce softer and more luxurious textiles. This type of cotton accounts of 8 percent of the world’s cotton production, and it is significantly more expensive than Gossypium hirsutum. This ELS cotton variation is native to South America, and it has been exported to a variety of locations throughout the world. For instance, Pima cotton is a form of Gossypium barbadense, and producers cultivate this type of cotton in China, India, and other foreign nations. 3. Gossypium arboretum While most types of cotton grow on small bushes, Gossypium arboretum grows on larger bushes that could almost be considered to be trees. This type of cotton accounts for less than 2 percent of global production. 4. Gossypium herbaceum Also known as Levant cotton, this type of fiber is native to Africa and Arabia, and it contributes less than 2 percent to global cotton cultivation. ","102 Cotton Fabric Varieties 1. Short-staple cotton Short-staple (SS) cotton is any type of cotton that consists of fibers that are up to 1.125 inches long. While this type of cotton is great for everyday use, it isn’t as soft as other types of cotton. 2. Long-staple cotton Long-staple (LS) cotton is any type of cotton that consists of fibers that are between 1.125 and 1.25 inches long. This type of cotton is somewhat more luxurious than SS cotton. 3. Extra-long-staple cotton Extra-long staple (ELS) cotton is any type of cotton that consists of fibers that are longer than 1.25 inches. ELS cotton is the most luxurious and soft type of cotton in existence. 4. Egyptian cotton Egyptian cotton is a term that refers to certain forms of either LS or ELS cotton. Giza 45 cotton, for instance, is over 45 millimeters (1.77 inches) long, which makes it one of the longest and most luxurious varieties of cotton in existence. 5. Pima cotton Pima cotton is a type of ELS cotton that was created through a partnership between the U.S. government and the Pima Indians in the early 20th century. It is considered to be one of the most durable forms of cotton. 6. Supima cotton Supima cotton is a type Pima cotton that has received the blessing of the American Supima Association (ASA). To be considered “Supima,” Pima cotton can only be grown in the United States with organic cultivation practices. ","103 How Does Cotton Fabric Impact the Environment? Cotton production is inherently non-impactful on the environment. Since this type of textile is a natural fiber, it is biodegradable, and it doesn’t fill up waterways or contribute to other forms of pollution. However, the practices that manufacturers use to make cotton may be harmful to the environment. Cotton cultivation requires a huge amount of water, and producing this textile may also involve land repurposing. Since most cotton producers focus on cultivating the largest amount of fiber possible at the lowest cost, they don’t properly care for the land they use for cultivation. As a result, cotton cultivation frequently depletes the soil in the areas where it is grown. Most cotton producers worldwide resort to agrochemicals, such as pesticides and fertilizers, to grow their crops. These harmful chemicals run off into the surrounding water, poison the soil, and end up being present in potentially dangerous concentrations in end products. In the vast majority of instances, cotton cultivation is an exploitative practice in which international corporations take advantage of poor, uneducated people in third-world countries to produce these fibers. This practice is harmful to communities, and it supports a cycle of poverty that results in reduced life expectancy and multiple succeeding generations of servitude. It’s possible, however, to cultivate cotton with organic means. Organic cultivation processes do not involve any artificial pesticides or fertilizers, which reduces the environmental impact of the production of this textile fiber. To be certified as organic, cotton cultivators must also promote sustainability within the communities where they operate. Workers who produce organic cotton must be compensated fairly, and environmental degradation must be kept to a minimum. Certain kinds of cotton, such as Supima cotton, are only available in organic forms. ","104 Modal Fabric Some call it the underwear fabric and some just look at it as an environmentally- friendly textile option. Either way, modal is revolutionizing the fashion industry with its lightweight, stretchy, and breathable nature that takes beech tree pulp and turns it into an eco-conscious, durable option for clothing and housewares. What Is Modal Fabric? Modal fabric is a semi- synthetic fabric made from beech tree pulp that is used primarily for clothing, such as underwear and pajamas, and household items, like bed sheets and towels. Modal is a form of rayon, another plant- based textile, though it is slightly more durable and flexible than the standard version. Modal is often blended with other fibers like cotton and spandex for added strength. Modal is considered a luxurious textile thanks to both its soft feel and high cost, as it is more expensive than either cotton or viscose. ","105 Modal was originally developed in Japan in the 1950s. Today, most modals are produced by the Austrian company Lenzing AG, which has the trademark for the fabric; its brands include Lenzing Modal, China Modal, and Formatex. There are even lighter versions of the material dubbed MicroModal and Modal Air by Lenzing. These versions are even finer knit than the standard modal and make the end product softer, therefore items made from these fabrics are considered even more luxurious. How Is Modal Fabric Manufactured? Modal fabric is a bio-based fabric that is made from spinning reconstituted beech tree cellulose. Modal is generally considered a more eco-friendly alternative to cotton because beech trees don’t require much water to grow and therefore the production process uses about 10-20 times less water. Even though the material is plant-derived, the production process includes soaking the fabric in chemicals like sodium hydroxide and carbon disulfide, which in turn classify modal as semi-synthetic. Modal is a type of rayon fabric, but it is generally more durable than regular rayon and feels softer, like cotton. Production Guide: What Is the Production Process for Modal? ● Beech trees are harvested, chipped, and cellulose is extracted from the pulp. ● Next, the cellulose is made into sheets, which are soaked in sodium hydroxide. ● Those sheets are broken into smaller pieces, which are soaked in carbon disulfate. This produces sodium cellulose xanthate. ● Cellulose xanthate is soaked in sodium hydroxide again. The subsequent liquid solution is put through a spinneret, which is a device with a series of holes that help create fibers. ● The created fibers are soaked in sulfuric acid to form yarn. Once washed, bleached, and dried, the yarn is loaded onto spools. ● From there, the yarn can be woven or knit into a fabric to form modal. Benefits of Using and Wearing Modal Fabric Modal is considered a luxury textile and is often used to blend with other fabrics to ","106 give a high-end feel with its lightness and softness. It has become very popular among eco-conscious fashion designers. ● Stretchy. Modal’s flexibility makes it ideal for items like t-shirts and athletic wear. ● Soft. Modal l has an incredible soft touch, and is often used for bed sheets,pajamas and undergarments. ● Breathable. Modal is great for sports clothing and everyday clothes because the fabric’s weave is very breathable. ● Water absorbent. Modal is 50% more absorbent than cotton; micropores inside the fabric absorb any water or sweat they come into contact with. ● Durable. Modal is very strong because of the tight weave and the long fibers and is therefore used for garments and housewares that receive regular use. ● Drapes well. Similar to rayon and other silk alternatives, modal has a beautiful drape that makes it ideal for clothing and decoration. ● Eco-friendly. Modal is made from regenerative plants and there are fewer chemicals used in the production process than with other types of rayon. ● Don't take pills. The fabric resists pilling and has a smooth finish that makes it ideal for everyday wear and use. ● Color fast. The fabric absorbs dye in warm water and does not bleed dye during the laundering process. ● Doesn’t shrink. Unlike most forms of rayon, modal is much less likely to shrink in the wash. ● Biodegradable. Modal is completely biodegradable. ● Doesn’t crease. Modal resists wrinkles and will stay smooth with minimal ironing. How Do You Care for Modal Clothes? Modals can be washed in the washing machine and tumble dried. However, be sure to check the item’s washing instructions, as a modal blend (with textiles like cotton and spandex) might have different requirements. Wash in cold water. Pure modal can be washed in any water temperature, though cold water is ideal. Dry cleaning is not necessary, unlike most rayons. ","107 Use oxygen-based bleach. Chlorine bleach can weaken the fabric, so it should be avoided in the washing process. Dry on low to medium heat. Make sure you take your items out of the dryer right away—or even when a little bit damp—to avoid wrinkling. Hang up immediately. What Is the Difference Between Modal and Viscose? Modal is what’s called a “high wet modulus rayon,” which means it’s a type of rayon that’s stronger when wet and doesn’t lose its shape, which is not true for viscose. The production process for modal is almost exactly the same as that for viscose, but the fibers used in modal undergo more processing which makes the final product stronger, lighter, and more breathable. Modal is more environmentally friendly than viscose because lower concentrations of sodium hydroxide are used to make it. What Is the Difference Between Modal and Lyocell? Modal is also very similar to lyocell, which is a completely organic form of rayon. The two are big competitors as luxury fabric. Lyocell is even more eco-friendly than modal because lyocell is made using an organic solution that replaces the sodium hydroxide used in modal. Lyocell can be made from different types of trees, including beech trees and eucalyptus. ","108 Silk Fabric Silk is a natural fiber known for its luster, shine, strength, and durability, and it has a long trading history across the world. Silk is the epitome of luxury due to its high cost to produce, soft feel, and elegant appearance, and it is thus a popular textile in high- end and couture fashion design. What Is Silk? Silk is a natural fiber produced by insects as a material for their nests and cocoons. There are several types of insects that produce silk, including silkworms (the most common type of silk), beetles, honey bees, bumble bees, hornets, weaver ants, and many more. Made primarily of a protein called fibroin, silk is known for its shine and softness as a material. What Is the History of Silk Production? The earliest example of silk fabric comes from China when it was used in a child’s tomb to wrap the body. China dominated the silk industry for many years, and initially the material was reserved for the Emperor. The Chinese used silk as a form of currency, and cost was measured in lengths of silk. The Silk Road, which connected industries from the East to the West, was a popular trading route named for the material, and that region of the world still maintains the name today. ","109 Eventually silk production moved to Korea, Thailand, India, and Europe. The material finally made its way to the U.S. in the seventeenth century. King James I introduced silk to the colonies, but many of the country’s early settlers couldn’t afford the material. Patterson, New Jersey and Manchester, Connecticut both became centers of silk production in the United States, until the trade and production was disrupted by World War II, leading to the creation of synthetic fabrics like nylon. How Is Silk Made? The process of making silk is called sericulture, and it involves harvesting silkworms for the material. ● Larvae are fed mulberry leaves. ● After they have molted several times, they spin a cocoon. The silk solidifies upon contact with air. This process takes about 2 to3 days. ● Once the cocoon is formed, it is dropped into a pot of boiling water effectively killing the pupae. ● The silk filament is extracted by brushing the cocoon. ● The raw silk is woven or knit into a fabric or spun into a yarn. Note that it takes about 2500 silkworms to spin a pound of raw silk. Each cocoon contains about a mile of silk filament, and one thread of silk is made of 48 silk filaments. Different weaving processes result in different types of fabric, including crepe (a rough crinkled texture), organza (a thin, sheer fabric), and chiffon (a lightweight, plain-weave fabric with a slight stretch). What Are the Pros and Cons of Silk Fabric? Silk is known for its beautiful drape and absorbent nature, along with other positive factors, including: ● Texture. Silk is incredibly soft with a flattering sheen, giving it a high-end and luxurious appeal. ● Strength and durability. It is also one of the strongest natural fibers, though some of its strength diminishes upon getting wet. Silk is often blended with ","110 other fibers, such as cotton, for added sturdiness. ● Elasticity. The material’s flexibility makes it ideal for garments and upholstery. ● Absorbency. Silk is one of the most absorbent fabrics, therefore it handles moisture well in clothing items. However silk has some drawbacks as well, including: ● Static cling. Since the material does not conduct electricity well, it can experience a lot of static. ● Shrinkage. The fabric shrinks in the wash so a silk clothing item should always be dry-cleaned or the material should be washed before the clothing item is constructed. 8 Primary Uses for Silk Fabric Silk is primarily used in garments and household items, but it is also employed in unexpected ways, such as in bicycle tires and in medicine. Silk is great for summer clothing because of its absorbent nature and how it wicks moisture, and it is also a staple for winter wear since it has low conductive properties. Here are some examples of the material’s many uses. ● Bridal and formal wear. Silk is a staple of many gowns and dresses thanks to its beautiful drape, and the long floats of yarn on one side create a dressy and lustrous appearance. ● Ties and scarves. The material’s strength and nuances with color make it ideal for accessories. Many high-end ties are made from heavy silk, which allows for tightly woven patterns, rich colors, and durable material. Silk is also a great material for scarves for both decoration and for warmth. ● Bedding. Silk sheets are the height of luxury and the material’s softness and absorbent nature makes it truly shine in the bedroom. ● Parachutes. Silk was originally used for parachutes for its strength and elastic properties; however nylon is more commonly used today. ● Upholstery. Silk is used to cover furniture and pillows, and thanks to its strength and durability, it provides a long-lasting covering. ","111 ● Wall hangings. Decorative wall hangings are often woven from silk, as the material is beautiful and dynamically reacts with colors and dyes. ● Bicycle tires. The material is sometimes used in the tire’s casing because of its lightness, durability, and flexibility. Since silk can be expensive, the casings can also be made from nylon and cotton. ● Surgical sutures. Since silk is a natural material, it has amazing uses in medicine. The material does not cause an autoimmune response and cannot be absorbed by the human body. Spandex / Lycra Fabric Lycra Fabric? Lycra is a brand name for elastane, which is a highly elastic synthetic fabric. Despite having different names, Lycra, spandex, and elastane are all the same material, and these fabrics can stretch to 5-8 times their usual size. This fabric was originally developed by the DuPont Corporation in the 1950s, but it would not exist if polyurethane had not been invented by IG Farben in the 1930s in Nazi Germany. Polyurethane now represents the base material for a number of different plastics, and the same basic chemical synthesis methods are used to make Lycra that are used to make other polyurethane-based plastics. Like other polyurethane materials, Lycra fabric is a polymer, which means that it is composed of long chains of monomers that are connected with a special type of acid. Unlike many other ","112 types of synthetic fabrics, Lycra is highly resistant to heat, and it was quickly recognized as an excellent addition to heat-sensitive synthetics like polyester and nylon. Polyurethane was originally developed by IG Farben as an alternative to rubber, and as soon as this substance was synthesized, its ability to absorb heat and kinetic energy was also noted, and polyurethane is commonly used in various forms of insulation to this day. Many of the key scientists at IG Farben were imported into the United States after World War II, and a variety of these scientists started working at DuPont. This collaboration between German scientists and DuPont's massive industrial might gave rise to a number of different useful inventions, and Lycra is one innovation that has had a particularly long-lasting impact on the world economy and consumer lifestyles in developed and developing nations. Lycra and similar fibers remain highly popular throughout the world, and even though this type of fabric can have a significantly negative environmental impact after it is produced, it's unlikely that the popularity of Lycra will decline in the foreseeable future. How Is Lycra Fabric Made? Lycra is a fully synthetic fiber, which means that all of its components are created in laboratory settings. While many of the constituent parts that are used to create the chemicals in Lycra fabric have organic origins, by the time that they are formed into Lycra fibers, they have been formulated and reformulated to the extent that they have no relation to organic components. There are four ways to make Lycra, but most of these methods have been almost entirely discarded. While some manufacturers may still use reaction spinning, solution wet spinning, or melt extrusion to make elastane products, a method known as solution dry spinning makes up almost 95 percent of global Lycra production. This process begins when macroglycol and a diisocyanate monomer are mixed to create the prepolymer that serves as the base ingredient of Lycra. Next, the solution is exposed to minutely calibrated levels of heat and pressure, which instigates the chemical reaction that forms the prepolymer. If the volume ratio between these two substances is out of balance, the prepolymer will not form, and a ration of 1:2 is ","113 observed in most applications. The prepolymer is then exposed to diamine acid, which produces another chemical reaction called chain extrusion reaction. The substance that results from this reaction is thick and viscous to the point of being sludge-like, so a solvent is then used to thin the solution and make it easier to work with. Next, the thinned solution is loaded into a cylindrical machine called a fiber production cell. This machine contains a specialized type of spinneret, and once the solution is loaded, the fiber production cell begins to spin, which forces the solution through the spinneret. The solution comes out the other side of the spinneret in the form of fibers, but these fibers still must be exposed to a heated nitrogen and solvent gas solution before they transition from a liquid into a solid state. Once they are solid, the fibers can be extruded from the cylindrical spinning cell, and they are then formed into strands with a compressed air device. This high-pressure air also twists the strands, and the resulting yarn can be formed in a variety of different sizes to fill the various uses of Lycra in the consumer textile industry. Before Lycra yarn can leave the factory floor and be woven into fabric, it still needs to be exposed to a finishing agent consisting of magnesium stearate or a similar polymer. Lastly, the Lycra yarn is transferred to a large spool, and it is shipped out to a textile manufacturing plant. How Is Lycra Fabric Used? Lycra is used in a wide variety of different forms of consumer textiles. Since the early days of Lycra fabric production, the incredible elasticity of this substance has been noted as being highly desirable in certain consumer apparel markets, but elastane fabrics are very rarely marketed on their own. Instead, this fabric is usually woven into other types of textiles to increase their overall elasticity. If a small amount of spandex is woven into polyester, cotton, or wool, for instance, these fabrics become much more elastic. In determining the increased elasticity that will be noted in fabrics once elastane is introduced, textile manufacturers keep in mind that this fabric stretches up to eight times its original size. Therefore, if 10 percent spandex is included in an otherwise rigid textile, it should be able to stretch to roughly twice its original size. ","114 Lycra is most popular in types of garments that are form-fitting. It is, for instance, commonly used in sheer underwear for men and women; most types of undergarments that ride close to the skin contain at least some amount of this substance. Even boxer briefs for men, which are typically baggy, include some amount of spandex in their waistbands to help them fit tightly around the abdomen. This fabric is also commonly found in the waistbands of sweatpants, loungewear, or any other types of underwear or bottoms that are designed to be stretchy. Beyond waistbands, Lycra is used in most types of socks; without the presence of this substance, socks would be significantly less stretchy, and they would be harder to put on and remove. In addition, almost every type of sportswear contains at least some amount of Lycra. Apparel used while biking, hiking, or swimming is usually designed to ride close to the skin, and elastane enables these types of clothes to be tight-fitting without causing discomfort. Even though Lycra differs from nylon in that it isn't made into plastics, this fabric does have a place in at least one industrial application. Actors in the film industry sometimes wear types of apparel called motion capture suits, and these suits are designed to cling to every part of the body. When positioned in front of a green screen, motion capture suits allow film producers to insert three-dimensional characters that look incredibly realistic. Where Is Lycra Fabric Produced? Lycra is a trademark of DuPont, and it is only made by this international corporation. DuPont has manufacturing locations in more than 90 countries, which means that this fabric could be made in any number of areas around the world. Overall, the international spandex industry has shifted eastward in the last few decades as China has risen to the fore as the dominant manufacturing power in the world. DuPont has a number of factories in China, and many other companies also manufacture spandex in this country. The future of Lycra fabric production around the world looks bright. A ReportBuyer report from 2018 indicates that this fabric will continue to be made in greater and ","115 greater quantities until at least 2023, and all signs indicate that this production boom will continue far past this projected date. What Different Types of Lycra Fabric Are There? Aside from the varied manufacturing processes that can be used to make this fabric, there are no distinct differences between Lycra, elastane, and spandex. It is, however, important to know more about each term: ● Lycra: As a registered trademark of the DuPont corporation, the \"Lycra\" brand is one of the most reliable and high-quality forms of elastane fabric on the market. However, elastane that has been branded as Lycra can sometimes cost more than other types of spandex. ● Elastane: The term \"elastane\" is most commonly used in Europe, and each continental European language has a slightly different version of this word. Elastane is the most technically correct term used to describe these polyether-polyurea copolymer fabrics. ● Spandex: Despite the persistence of a common misconception, spandex is not a registered trademark of any company. Instead, it is the term that DuPont originally used to describe their polyurethane fabric during the development process. \"Spandex\" is an anagram of \"expands,\" and the attractive simplicity of this name has made it the preferred term for referring to elastane products in the United States and elsewhere. How Does Lycra Fabric Impact the Environment? The production of Lycra is not considered to be inherently detrimental to the environment. While it's true that the production of elastane fabrics requires high levels of energy and the use of a variety of toxic chemicals, unlike fabrics like nylon, the raw ingredients for Lycra are not derived from non-renewable resources like petroleum oil. Instead, these ingredients are fully synthesized in laboratory settings, and DuPont is one of the world's leaders in sustainable and safe elastane manufacturing processes. There's no getting around the fact that the production of Lycra involves carcinogenic chemicals, but scientific research has indicated that elastane factory workers in ","116 Sweden exhibit negligibly greater cancer risk, which seems to indicate that workplaces in which this material is made are not very hazardous. No studies have been done, however, to examine the impact of elastane production on workers in other countries. Polyurethane has been noted to contain isocyanates, which are carcinogenic chemicals that can cause respiratory issues in children and adults. While it's possible that spandex also contains these harmful chemicals, the presence of isocyanates in this fabric has not been confirmed. While the process of creating Lycra is not notably bad for the environment, this fabric is significantly detrimental to environmental health after it is sold to consumers. Research has determined that 60 percent of the trash present in waterways is composed of non-biodegradable fabric fibers, and Lycra doesn't biodegrade. Even if apparel containing this fabric is disposed of responsibly, consumers contribute to this pollution issue whenever they wash their Lycra clothing; elastane fibers break off with every washing and contaminate the water supply. It may take thousands or even millions of years for all of the world's Lycra to biodegrade. In the meantime, giant trash islands made from textiles and other plastics continue to grow in many of the world's oceans. ","117 Jersey Fabric What is jersey fabric? Jersey is a knit fabric that is commonly used in clothing. In the past, most jersey fabric was made with wool, but it’s now more common to find cotton and synthetic jersey garments. While many athletic jerseys are made with jersey fabric, the fabric “jersey” is different from the garment “athletic jersey.” Characterized by its considerable stretchiness and close knit, jersey is a popular fabric for underwear, T-shirts, and other types of garments that you wear close to your skin. Since it is lightweight, the jersey is not remarkably durable or insulative, but it is ideal as a base layer worn beneath thicker and more durable clothing. Jersey is highly absorbent, and it is very breathable despite its fully opaque, close-knit structure. This structure provides a jersey with an attractive drape, and the intensity of this draping effect varies depending on the material used. History of jersey fabric Jersey fabric originated in the Channel Islands, where it was primarily used to make ","118 underwear and fishermen’s sweaters. Records indicate that jersey knits existed as early as the Middle Ages, and this knit gradually gained popularity throughout Western Europe during the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods. The Channel Islands are a group of islands in the English Channel. These islands changed hands multiple times between the Middle Ages and today, and even though they are currently under the protection of the United Kingdom, they are not officially part of the UK. Therefore, it is difficult to establish the exact heritage of jersey fabric, but fabric aficionados generally consider jersey to be British. What’s certain is that jersey fabric was named after the island of Jersey, which is the largest landmass in the Channel Islands. As its influence around the world spread, England became a major textile exporter, and by the mid-1800s, jersey fabric had become well-known enough throughout Europe and the United States to become the default fabric for men’s sports uniforms. Until the 20th century, however, the popularity of jersey fabric remained limited, and it was mostly relegated to the realm of men’s underwear and athletic or work clothing. Everything changed in 1916 when iconic fashion designer Coco Chanel made the bold move of including jersey fabric in classy garments. Despite its use in sports uniforms, jersey still suffered from an association with underwear, and using this fabric in normal garments was seen as relatively risque. Due to the overwhelming popularity of her designs, however, Chanel’s jersey garments became universally admired, and competing designers quickly adopted the jersey fabric trend she had started. Jersey fabric today Within no time, jersey fabric made its way into apparel categories as diverse as evening wear, blouses, and, perhaps most notably, T-shirts. While other applications of jersey have remained largely contained within niche categories, the T-shirt is one of the most ubiquitous types of garments on the face of the planet. If you’ve ever worn a T-shirt, you’ve worn jersey fabric, and you know from experience just how soft ","119 and breathable this fabric can be. One of the most notable changes to jersey that occurred as this fabric became an international superstar is the type of material it most commonly contains. Back when knitters on the Channel Islands were responsible for the entirety of the world’s jersey supply, this fabric was made exclusively with wool. These days, however, cotton is the most common jersey material, and this fabric also frequently contains synthetic fibers. How is jersey fabric made? The production process used to make Jersey fabric varies significantly depending on the types of fibers it contains. Wool, for instance, is an animal product that textile manufacturers derive from the coats of sheep, goats, or other animal species. Cotton, on the other hand, is a plant product derived from the fluffy coverings of seed pods. Synthetic fibers, which can also be present in jersey fabric, are created by combining various chemicals to produce usable textile materials. Whichever type of fiber jersey fabric contains, however, knitting this fabric follows the same universal process. Jersey manufacturers begin by taking cotton, wool, or synthetic yarn and loading it into an automated knitting machine. It’s also certainly possible to knit a jersey by hand, but this process is labor-intensive and inefficient. The knitting machine then twists and combines yarn to create the distinctive, close- knit structure of jersey fabric. Once complete, jersey fabric looks like a latticework of twisted vertical yarns connected by untwisted horizontal yarns. In some cases, yarn intended for manufacture into jersey garments is dyed prior to the knitting process, and in other scenarios, textile manufacturers dye fabric once it is finished. Depending on the material used, textile manufacturers may also apply flame retardants or other finishing treatments to improve the appearance or durability of jersey fabric. ","120 How is jersey fabric used? Coco Chanel’s use of jersey in high fashion may have been the factor that originally made this fabric popular, but jersey is no longer a common sight on the catwalk. Instead, this fabric has become ubiquitous as a default material for run-of-the-mill, everyday garments. Textile manufacturers primarily use jersey fabric to make casual, lightweight garments like T-shirts and underwear. There are quite a few different types of jersey fabric, however, and manufacturers might use certain types of jersey for more heavy- duty applications. Of course, a jersey is also a popular choice for athletic wear. While sports uniforms most commonly feature synthetic fibers these days, many athletic shirts, tank tops, and shorts feature jersey knits. Applications of jersey fabric mainly remain limited to apparel, but one notable non- apparel example of a jersey fabric application is bedding. Due to its tight-knit softness, textile manufacturers commonly use jersey fabric to make bed sheets, pillowcases, and even blankets. Where is jersey fabric produced? While a handful of artisans still produce traditional jersey fabric on the island of Jersey in the Channel Islands, gone are the days when these British protectorates produced the majority of the world’s jersey. These days, China is the overall largest textile producer, and this nation is also the largest exporter of both cotton and synthetic textiles. Wool, however, remains a popular fabric material for jersey production, and the largest exporter of this natural animal textile is Australia. This Oceanian nation has more sheep per capita than any other nation, so it’s unsurprising that Australia is the world’s wool capital. How much does jersey fabric cost? The price of jersey fabric varies depending on the textile fibers it contains. Out of all ","121 the textile materials on the market, synthetic materials like polyester and rayon are the least expensive, but plant-based natural materials like cotton can be nearly the same price as synthetic fibers. Wool, on the other hand, is slightly more expensive than cotton and considerably more expensive than synthetic fibers. High-quality wool and cotton textiles that are organic and sustainably harvested command the highest market prices out of all the available jersey materials. Since the jersey knit is relatively simple, this type of fabric is not inherently more expensive than other types of woven or knitted garments. There are quite a few different distinct types of jersey fabric: 1. Single jersey Defined as jersey-knit fabric weighing less than 140g per square meter, single jersey fabric has one flat side and one piled side. It consists of a single sheet of knit fabric. 2. Interlock jersey Interlock jersey, also known as double jersey, features two sheets of jersey fabric attached along their piled sides. The resulting fabric is smooth and flat on both sides, and since it has double the thickness of single jersey, it is more insulative and durable. 3. Jacquard jersey Like other jacquard fabrics, jacquard jersey features designs that range from simple shapes to complex brocade-like patterns. Textile manufacturers use industrial knitting machines to make these patterns. 4. Clocqué jersey Clocqué (French for “blister”) jersey features a puckered, raised pattern that textile manufacturers create with knitting machines. 5. Stretch jersey ","122 Stretch jersey is a type of fabric that features a common jersey fabric material, such as wool or polyester, combined with spandex or a similar elastic fiber. 6. Slub jersey Slub jersey has a textured pattern that results from using irregular slub yarn in the process of weaving jersey fabric. How does jersey fabric impact the environment? The environmental impact of jersey fabric varies depending on the types of fibers it contains. Synthetic fibers, for instance, have a remarkably negative impact on the environment. Producing polyester and rayon involves the use of toxic chemicals during the production process, and while it’s sometimes possible to contain or reuse these chemicals, they inevitably end up contaminating local ecosystems even if they are handled properly. From there, synthetic fibers also release toxic microfibers into the water supply with every washing. At the end of its life cycle, synthetic fabric enters the environment in the form of non-biodegradable pollution. As a result, using synthetic fibers to produce jersey fabric is environmentally unsustainable. Wool and cotton, on the other hand, both have the potential to be completely environmentally sustainable. Cotton cultivators commonly use toxic agrochemicals, but it is possible to grow cotton without using agricultural pollutants, and cotton is highly biodegradable. Since wool is an animal product, the production of this fiber does not involve agrochemicals, and improper land use is the only potential negative environmental impact of producing this fiber. Wool is also highly biodegradable, making this fiber the most inherently environmentally friendly jersey fabric material. ","123 Tricot Fabric Tricot (pronounced the-ko) comes from the French verb tricoter, meaning to knit. Tricot fabric has a unique zigzag weave that is textured on one side and smooth on the other. This allows the fabric to be soft and also very sturdy for activewear. Tricot fabric is a knit material that is woven on a flatbed knitting machine. The tricot weave creates a zigzag effect on the front of the fabric and a crosswise rib on the back. Smooth, soft, and stretchy, it can be made from both synthetic and natural fibers. Main uses for tricot include swimsuits, activewear, and linings. Construction of Tricot Fabric Tricot fabrics are produced on a flatbed knitting machine, as opposed to a circular knitting machine. They have an excellent wrinkle and run resistance, as well as good drape-ability. A tricot knit is ideal for activewear, especially when composed of Nylon Spandex or Polyester Spandex blends. These blends allow the fabric to breathe and not cling to the body while also providing support and the comfort of a 4-way stretch fabric. Tricot Characteristics Tricot is a warp-knit fabric. This means it has continuous lengthwise columns of loops. Warp knitting differs from weft knitting by having each needle loop its own thread. The needles produce parallel rows of loops that create the interlocked zigzag pattern seen here. These lengthwise loops are what give this fabric a smooth surface on the face and a textured back. This structure creates ribs on the front and crosswise ribs on the back. This makes the tricot both soft and an incredibly durable knit structure. ","124 This knitting process creates a soft and flexible tricot that does not snag or run easily. High-quality tricot will not build up a static charge or cling to the body to ensure that it is comfortable to wear. Tricots come in a variety of colors and patterns. What Is Tricot Fabric? Tricot is the name of a specific warp-based fabric. It comes from the French verb, ‘Tricoter’, which means knitting. Pronounced “tree-coat”, or “tree-co” to be closer to its French origins, this fabric is a unique knit material. The reason it stands out from other knits is that it isn’t knitted in the same way. Kira Matte Tricot Skin Glow Nude, Fabric by the YardWhile most knit fabrics are made on round or circular knitting machines, tricot is woven on a flatbed knitting machine. Being warp-based means the warp, or lengthways threads, are dominant. They are formed into loops and interwoven with weft threads in different ratios to create a lengthways rib pattern on the fabric front and a crosswise rib on the back. This is what gives the material its individual texture and durability. It’s also why a tricot fabric is easier to work with than any other knit. With the stability and firmness of woven fabric and the stretch of a knit, the textile has the best of both worlds. Properties of a tricot textile are determined by the fiber content. Their characteristics can include heat-retention, water-absorption, quick-drying, antibacterial, and form- fitting. Whatever the fiber content, all tricot materials are run-resistant. Is Tricot Fabric Synthetic or Natural Fiber? As the name tricot refers to the weave rather than the fiber it’s made from, you can find it in synthetic and natural fiber options. Synthetic versions tend to be more stretchy and are used in swimwear or sportswear. Due to the higher versatility of synthetic material, you’ll usually find tricot fabric made from nylon and spandex or polyester and spandex. There may be a small percentage of natural fiber like cotton in some, but the fully synthetic variety is the most popular. ","125 As tricot is woven rather than knitted, it isn’t naturally stretchy. To achieve the 2-way or even 4-way stretch for activewear and some lingerie, the addition of spandex is essential. How Is Tricot Fabric Made? 108'' 40 Denier Tricot Turquoise, Fabric by the YardTricot fabric is a soft, durable knit. It’s made from knitting warp and weft threads together on a flatbed knitting machine. The machine is similar to a loom, so rather than being knitted, tricot is woven. In a tricot textile, the warp thread is the focus of the fabric and dominates the pattern. Each needle on the flatbed knitting machine forms a loop within its own thread. It’s like a series of slip knots all on one strand. The knitting machine has several needles, all creating strands with parallel slip knots. These slip knots are then moved sideways from one needle to another in a zigzag motion. They interlock with the knots on other strands to knit the fabric together. It’s this zigzag that gives tricot material its unique texture and feel. There are three different pattern types for tricot fabric. They are called Denby, Cord, and Atlas. Each one is a variation of the slip knots on one strand pattern. The distance between each knot and the length of the zigzag form different patterns within the fabric. Structure, texture, and the feel of the material can change with each different tricot knit pattern. The one thing that stays the same, though, is the similarity between all tricot fabrics. There will be a zigzag ribbed effect running up and down the fabric on the front. A crosswise rib will be evident on the back. What Are the Advantages of Tricot Fabric Tricot fabrics are sturdy and durable and have many of the same properties of a woven fabric. Including a greater resistance to static cling and a fabric that is easier to work with than other knits. Let’s take a look at the advantages of tricot fabric in detail. ","126 Mystic Hologram Lame Tricot Rose Gold, Fabric by the YardAll knits have a certain amount of stretch. This is down to the way the fabric is constructed. A knit material like a jersey knit is looser and less stiff than a woven. Garments made from jersey tend to be less structured and need fewer fastenings. The material gives enough to allow you to get in and out without the need for zippers or buttons. It’s one of the benefits of a knit fabric. Being stretchy and loosely put together can make knit fabrics a pain to work with. The inbuilt stretch can be problematic. Knit textiles are notorious for moving around and stretching out of shape when you sew. Tricot isn’t like that. It’s knitted on a flatbed knitting machine which acts in a similar way to a loom. Instead of being knitted like jersey fabric, the yarns are woven together. The material is warp-based, which gives a level of rigidity to the fabric not found in other knits. This gives a tighter construction and added stability. While still keeping the inherent stretch and movement found in a regular knit, tricot behaves like a woven fabric. Not only does this make tricot easier to work with, but it also gives the fabric the capability to retain its shape. Care and Maintenance Caring for a garment made from a tricot fabric is simple. Tricot won’t stretch in the wash. It’s wrinkle and crease-resistant and incredibly quick-drying. So quick, you don’t need to use a dryer. Leave it to air dry and it will be ready to wear the next day. One of the best things about tricot is its shape-retaining properties. It’s a wash-and- go fabric designed for a fast-paced, active lifestyle. Unlike other knits, there are fewer things to worry about when caring for a tricot fabric. As the fabric is run-resistant, you don’t have to worry about a loose thread getting caught on the zipper from another garment and unraveling. Tricot is a lot more durable and robust than a regular knit fabric. ","127 Comfort and Breathability Unlike many synthetic materials, a tricot fabric is breathable even when it’s made from nylon or polyester! The structure and construction of a knit fabric is inherently porous. The little gaps created between the threads allow for air and moisture to escape. This makes a tricot garment comfortable and cooling in hot weather. It helps prevent you from feeling clammy, sticky, and miserable. Better still, the unique weave of a tricot knit fabric stops it from clinging to you as the temperature rises. A tricot fabric has incredible drape, far superior to any other knit fabric. Coupled with the addition of spandex, the built-in stretch of tricot can be enhanced to a 4-way stretch. Offering free movement yet still maintaining a sturdy structure for support, tricot is an all-around miracle fabric with a comfort factor off the scale. What Are the Disadvantages of Tricot Fabric? Most fabrics will have some disadvantages. Tricot’s bad points can vary depending on the fiber the fabric contains. As a tricot knit can be made from synthetic and natural fibers, the downsides can span the full spectrum of issues faced by different textiles. A tricot knit tends to be synthetic-based, though. So let’s take a look at the main disadvantages faced by synthetic tricot textiles. UV Resistance and Sun Damage The level of UV resistance you can get from a tricot fabric is a little higher than other knit fabrics. However, even though it is more tightly woven, the protection offered will be low compared to other woven fabrics. As a knit material, it has holes, so it will allow some UV rays to infiltrate through to your skin. Tricot made from either a nylon-spandex or polyester-spandex in a heavy denier will offer better protection than a lightweight option. Nylon degrades in sunlight in a relatively short timeframe. This can reduce the UV protection offered by your tricot garment. It also means you will need to replace your ","128 clothing regularly, preferably as soon as you see signs of damage such as color fading. Different Weights and Fiber Content One of the main things to watch for with tricot fabric is that it can be made from synthetic and natural fibers. The type of fiber will make a difference to the amount of stretch fabric has and the amount of opaqueness. The problem is, it’s not always apparent which tricot option you are dealing with. Especially in cheaper, low-quality materials. A budget-friendly fabric may be great for your pocket, but if it’s a see-through tricot, your sportswear may show off more than your sporting prowess. Pay particular attention to the label when purchasing tricot fabric to make sure the fiber content will match what you want to make. You don’t want a cotton-based tricot if you are making a swimsuit. Similarly, a swimsuit-grade tricot isn’t going to make a great lining fabric. Resilience to Everyday Wear This one is a bit bitter-sweet. Although tricot knit fabrics are durable and run- resistant, they can be damaged easier than you think. The problem is the run resistance. While it’s great to not have to worry about a snag or pull in the fabric turning into an unsightly ladder-style hole, not worrying about it can lead you to miss the early signs of damage. Tricot may not run the same as many other knits, but it can snag easily. It’s still a knit, after all, and those pesky fibers can still catch on the slightest little thing. Like a buckle or a zipper pull, or even the rivets on your jeans. Instead of runs, you could end up with lots of tiny pulls in the fabric. Always be careful what you wash your tricot garment with. Keep clear of any garment with fastenings or embellishments. That way, you can keep your tricot safe from snags. ","129 Heat Intolerance Caring for tricot may be a lot easier than with other knits, but there is a downside. You do have to take care when it comes to heat. As a tricot knit is usually made from either a nylon-spandex or polyester-spandex blend, it’s a synthetic material. Like all synthetics, heat can be a big problem for tricot. Too high a temperature in your washing machine can cause the fabric to melt. It’s not just the wash you have to be careful with when it comes to heat. A polyester- based tricot fabric not only melts but also burns easily. This can make the humble family stove or electric heater a nightmare. Heat is not a friend to polyester in any form, so keep away from heat sources while you’re wearing it. Using a dryer can also be a little problematic, especially if you forget and leave the dryer on a high setting. The best way to dry a tricot fabric is naturally. Air dry outside away from direct sunlight to reduce the risk of heart damage. What Is Tricot Fabric Used For? Tricot comes in different weights, known as the denier of the fabric. Ranging from very light and sheer fabrics to the heavier 40 denier options, this knit fabric can be used for many projects. Some deniers will offer more stretch, others will offer more opaqueness. Each one will offer the same durability and comfort. So what can you use a tricot knit fabric for? Let’s take a look at the most popular uses. Lingerie ","130 Shadowline Women's Silhouette Nylon Tricot Hi- Low Gown 35737 3X NavyProbably one of the more famous uses of tricot fabric is lingerie. The term lingerie covers everything from your underwear to sleepwear. So you’ll find 40 denier tricot fabric in panties, slips, nightgowns, and camisoles. Even the lighter 15 or 20 denier weights get a look in with lingerie. This weight can be used for light-dressing gowns like peignoirs. Or a sexy, sheer negligee. Sportswear adidas Women's Essentials 3- stripes Tricot Pant, Black/White, SmallTricot is incredibly comfortable and ideal for use in activewear or sportswear. Especially in the 4-way stretch options. Not only that, but the inbuilt breathability of the knit fabric will help keep you cool while you burn off your calories. From sports bras to yoga pants, a tricot weave will give you freedom of movement and the flexibility to engage in any sporting activity. You’ll be able to perform the most strenuous of workouts without feeling restricted by your clothing. Swimwear ","131 American Apparel Women's Standard Nylon Tricot High-Cut Sleeveless One-Piece, Black, MediumTo be effective, swimwear needs to be close-fitting and durable enough to withstand regular dips in the pool. Tricot fabric is both stretchy and soft and the perfect choice for swimsuits. With an amazing capacity to bounce back to its original shape, your swimwear will stay looking fresh and free from sagging. There’s nothing worse than a stretched-out swimsuit which is why tricot is so popular for this activity. Particularly when the tricot is a nylon-spandex blend. You get the incredible recovery of the tricot knit with the UV protection and chlorine resistance of the synthetic fibers it contains. It’s a perfect combination. Outerwear As tricot is the name of a fabric weave rather than fiber, it can be made from any material. Or even a blend of different fibers. Because of this, the products it can be used for are almost never-ending. It may have started as a lingerie material, but these days you’re just as likely to find tricot pants and jackets. The elasticity and softness of a tricot textile make a pair of pants extremely comfortable. Full of flexibility and smooth to the touch, tricot pants and jackets are a delight to wear all day. Particularly when you’re out on a hike. ","132 Lining A lesser-known use of tricot is as a lining for luggage and bags. This version tends to be less stretchy than the tricot used for sports apparel. Durable and long-lasting, the fabric will keep the inside of your luggage looking smart. It will also protect your clothing from being damaged from the case at the same time. How Much Is Tricot Fabric per Yard The price per yard varies depending on the fiber content and denier of the tricot fabric. The average cost ranges from around $7 to $13 per yard. You’ll find fabric quality and the retail outlet you purchase it from will make a difference to the amount you pay. So too will the manufacturer. You can expect to pay more for a well-known brand name. Conclusion Tricot fabric is a woven knit with incredible stretch and recovery. Its ability to bounce back and keep its original shape makes it one of the most versatile fabrics in the world.

Whatever type of sewing thread you choose look for quality thread brand names like Gutterman, Rasant, Coates and Clark, and Mettler. Quality sewing thread will always make the difference, especially when dealing with tricky fabrics such as silk, wool, and Lycra. WHAT DO SPECIALIZED SEWING THREADS ALLOW THE SEAMSTRESS TO DO? The type of sewing you are doing will determine the kind of thread you need. Are you using sewing thread for: ● Repairs, mending ● Dressmaking ","135 ● Embroidery or tapestry ● Upholstery ● Quilting ● Or maybe you are even trying the art of tatting. Check the manufacturer’s instructions to determine the thread required. Here are some of the most common sewing thread types. Sewing Thread Types ● Cotton is an all-purpose thread useful for all kinds of projects. ● Embroidery thread can be stranded and divided into strands for embroidery. There are usually six strands to choose from. ● Cotton Perle cannot be divided but is still an embroidery thread along with \"coton a broder\" which is used for cut-work. There are different cotton weights to look for if your task is more specialized. ● Tatting Cotton is highly specialized and suited to fine linen. ● Quilting thread coated with a waxy finish allows ease of movement through quilting and batting. ● Polyester/Cotton is a multipurpose weight (50) and suitable for all types of fabric including stretch. This is the most commonly used thread for most of your sewing. Choose a good quality with a reinforced center. ● Heavy-duty thread for soft furnishing (40) is a mixture of cotton and polyester. ● Rayon thread gives a nice finish to embroidery and flat stitches. ● Nylon is a strong thread useful for light to medium weight fabric. ● Silk often reserved for embroidery is a strong thread for use with silk and wool. There is also silk floss, twisted silk, and stranded silk. ● Wool threads are used for embroidery and blankets for heavy fabrics as well as canvas. There is also Persian wool, tapestry wool, and crewel. ● Invisible thread is a bit like fishing line and used for - you guessed it - an invisible finish. ● Added to all of that is a metallic thread in gold, silver and copper. ● A variegated thread will add interest to any sewing project. ● Shirring thread is elasticized for sewing rows in the waist or chest area. ","136 Understanding Thread Sizing 3 COMMON THREAD SIZING SYSTEMS TEX (T): Tex is the most consistent of the measuring methods. It uses a fixed length to measure the weight of a thread. Tex is the weight (in grams) of 1,000 meters of thread. Or, in other words, 1,000 meters of thread that weighs 1 gm. = 1 Tex. The higher the tex, the thicker the thread. DENIER COUNT (TD OR D): Denier also measures thread at a fixed length. It is the weight (in grams) of 9,000 meters (or 9 km) of thread. You might recognize the term from descriptions of nylon fabrics, which are often classified by the denier of the threads from which they are woven. COMMERCIAL SIZES (V): Commercial sizes are used for heavy-duty threads for sewing heavy upholstery, canvas or webbing. Commercial sizes are set sizes of 30, 46, 69, 92, 138, 207, 277, 346, 415 and 554. They are the thread’s denier divided by 10. Commercial sizes are standard for marine grade thread (you’ll see commercial sizes on the Sailrite website for our outdoor thread). Here’s a helpful chart that shows how the different sizing methods compare: ","137 ","138 Usage Of Thread Belt Loop ● On dresses, belt carriers are often simply thread loops positioned above and below the waistline side seam Embroidery ● The handicraft of decorating fabric or other materials with needle and thread or yarn ● Perfect for stitching on all types of fabric General Sewing / Polyester ● A medium-weight thread made from polyester ● Polyester is suitable for most fabrics because it has some stretch ● Polyester fiber is stronger than most natural thread Hem / Blind Stitch ● It's typically made of a single strand of polyester and has no color ● For dress trousers and skirts, evening/wedding gowns, sport coats, and curtains Jean Sewing ● Ideal for finishing recycled denim projects or hemming jeans with a professional look ● Heavy weight, top-stitch spun thread is consistently smooth and fuzz-free ● Knit ● Ideal for overedge and coverstitch seams because they offer excellent seam coverage and seam elasticity Leather / Suede ","139 ● Heavy duty size (TEX-40 to higher) ● Mostly Polyester and Bonded Nylon Metallic Thread ● A delicate metallic coating protected by an outer coating providing extremely vibrant color/glitter and/or texture. ● A man-made thread which is ideal for machine-embroidery or decorative serger finishes Sergers / Overlock ● Sergers threads are available in the same fibers as general sewing threads ● Designed to gently relax after it's sewn and cover the edge finish ● Spandex ● Allows to sew a straight seam with the sewing machine without the thread breaking when stretched Top Stitch ● Used most often on garment edges such as necklines and hems. ● Attaching details like pockets or tabs on zippers, especially on bags. Wax / Polyamide ● Perfect thread for hand finishing. ● Ideal substitute for silk skeins. ● Waxing makes the thread stiffer, more water and mildew resistant, and less stretchy ","140 INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT THREAD SIZE ● V-69 is the heaviest commercial size recommended for home sewing machines. ● Heavier threads make your stitching more visible. ● The thread size measures the thread’s thickness. If another weight is given for thread (like ounces), it refers to the amount of thread on the spool. ● Thread tends to get stronger as it gets heavier. ● The tension on your sewing machine will need adjusting when you switch thread weights. ● Try to use a needle where the eye is 40% larger than the thickness of the thread. ","141 Zipper Zippers are accessories attached to dresses, shoes, and bags, used as closures. Based on the application they are broadly categorized into Visible and Invisible Zippers. Sewing zippers is a lot simpler than most beginners believe. Which is very unfortunate because there are so many reasons to love zippers. They open an entire sewing world to you that is otherwise shut without them. You can wear structured clothing – giving yourself all the controlled curvature you could ever dream of. You can sew custom jackets so you don’t have to smear makeup down your face pulling a hoodie over your head. Heck, you can even put on a dress or a pair of pants without having to do the hokey pokey. The Anatomy of a Zipper ","142 Closed Bottom – A closed bottom zipper has a bar that goes across both sides of the base of the zipper (called the bottom stop), which keeps the zipper in one piece. Separating – A separating zipper, well, you guessed it – separates. These are typically found in jackets and coats. Now that we know the difference between those two, let’s take a look at the anatomy of a zipper: Pieces Explained Top Stop – Prevents your slider from coming off the top of the zipper Slider Body – Joins and separates the teeth as it slides up and down Pull Tab – What you use to move the Slider Body up and down Teeth/Chain – Hold the zipper together Tape – The fabric that the Teeth/Chain is attached to Bottom Stop – Prevents your slider from coming off of the bottom of the zipper (closed bottom zippers only) Insertion Pin – Secures the opposing side of the zipper in the Retainer Box (separating zippers only) Retainer Box – Secures the zipper together and prevents your slider from coming off of the bottom of the zipper (separating zippers only) ","143 Types of Zippers based on Element/Teeth Material There are 3 main categories of zippers which are based on 3 different types of materials as below: ● Metal Zippers: zipper-metalMetal zipper is the most basic original zipper first produced. The first zipper was made of metal around 1917 and 1920s. When the slider slides up in a zipper the elements get tightly interlocked to keep the zipper shut. Metal zippers are divided into 2 groups, depending on the material used and the process of manufacture: ● Teeth formed from a metal wire, either flat or profiled and made from brass, aluminum, nickel or white brass (nickel-free) ● Teeth die-cast directly onto the tape, with zinc metal Metal zippers are usually made in a variety of finishes, such as golden brass, antique brass, antique silver, gunmetal, silver etc. These finishes are achieved by chemical treatment of the zipper chain and matching plating of the sliders and end stops. Generally, metal zippers are available in various finishes, but most commonly used zipper finishes are as below: Aluminum: Elements are constructed using aluminum Brass: Elements are constructed using a brass alloy, typically a combination of copper and zinc Antique Brass: Elements made from brass that is chemically treated to give a worn- out brass appearance Black Oxidized: Elements are made from brass that is chemically treated to a black matte finish ","144 Molded Plastic Zippers zipper-molded-plasticThese plastic zippers have individually injected molded teeth, fused directly on to the tape of the zipper. The High-performance resins used to manufacture molded plastic elements are incredibly strong and make zippers that are durable, strong and flexible. These zippers are ideal for outerwear and heavyweight garments or any outdoor application. Plastic zippers are divided into 5 groups: ● LFC or L-type zippers made with a meander/Ruhrmann type coil stitched around the edge of the carrier tape. ● CFC zippers made with a spiral coil, stitched on one side of the carrier tape. ● Woven-in coil zippers, in which the coil is formed and directly woven into the carrier tape on special looms. ● Plastic molded zippers, in which the teeth/elements made from polyacetal (commonly known as Delrin‚ ) are directly molded onto the carrier tape. ● Plastic extruded zippers, in which a string of teeth/elements is first extruded and then stitched onto the carrier tape. Invisible Zippers The main categories of zippers, as described above, also include specialty zippers, which have special types of construction, or parts, or finishes. CFC zippers have a special class known as Invisible zippers due to the special construction and mode of use. These zippers do not require the provision of a fly since they are made and stitched in such a manner that only a hairline seam is visible from outside. These zips are predominantly used in ladies dresses and skirts. These zippers are available in knitted and woven tapes. ","145 Coil Zippers Coil zippers are made from a continuous coil of monofilament in place of individual teeth. Coil zippers are often referred to as nylon zippers. The teeth of these zippers are an extruded nylon strip sewn onto the zipper tape. These zippers are very flexible and are available in a variety of sizes (gauges). Coil zippers have many applications from fashion-wear to all types of tents and canvas goods and bags. Types of Zippers based on Functionality Zippers are always measured from “component to component” (end stops), regardless of zipper style. ● Closed-end zippers: Closed-end zippers are non-separating and are normally opened and closed with a slider. The bottom stop is made up of a single part and doesn’t allow complete separation of the chain. These zippers are used on trousers, jeans, bags, boots, etc. ● Open-end (separating) zippers: zipper-open-endOpen-end (separating) zippers have separated ends. The ending part is joined by a box and pin mechanism provided on the lower end of the zipper. The zippers are closed using sliders and are normally used on jackets and other outerwear. ","146 ● Two-way Zippers:These zippers are made usually in #5 or larger sizes in CFC, plastic molded and metal. The major applications are outerwear and luggage. These are made in X-type or Otype. Two-way separating zippers have separated ends as well. The bottom slider allows movement from the bottom of the zipper. These zippers are used in rainwear, sportswear, and sleeping bags. ● Two-Way head to head zippers have two sliders at the center of the chain when the zippers are closed. Head to head zippers can be open-end by pulling the sliders towards the stops, but cannot be separated because the ending parts have two stops that cannot be divided. These zippers are mainly used for bags, backpacks, and luggage. ● Two-way tail to tail (back to back) zippers has sliders on opposite ends when the zipper is closed. These zippers can be opened by pulling the sliders towards each other, but cannot be separated. They are used for overalls and anything else. ","147 Elastic Some fabrics are not stretchable. Once they get stretched they remain out of shape and are ruined. But with the elastic additive, your clothing items can have a little bounce to them and return to their original shape. What is elastic made of? Elastic is made from rubber and latex that have other flexible materials wrapped around it. Those materials are weaved together where the elastic characteristic does the most good and is not impeded in its purpose. To learn more about elastic and elastic fabric types just continue to read our article. It gives you the names of those fabrics and what makes them tick. When you are done you will probably know more about elastic fabrics than you wanted to know. Elastic fabric 1: Neoprene - this is a synthetic rubber compound that is used in scuba diving wetsuits and a host of fashion items. What is Elastic Fabric? Elastic fabric is a combination of materials that have elastic characteristics as well as flexible natures. The strands of each fabric are woven together to create a great elastic fabric that holds its shape even when it is stretched out. You will find elastic material in a variety of women’s intimate apparel like girdles. It is also found in belts, suspenders, waistbands, and a lot more clothing articles. Also, a lot of fashion accessories have elastic elements to them. Elastic fabrics are also used on bed skirting, fitted sheets, bed ruffles, and just about anywhere that requires you to have flexible fabric. On top of that elastic fabrics or yarns can help create some wonderful jewelry pieces for those people who like innovation and creativity. Elastic Fabric 2: latex is made from rubber but that compound is difficult to sew ","148 and it is hard to wear. It is not breathable fabric which means you may overheat if you wear it. What is Elastic Made Out Of? Two of the main sources for elastic are rubber and latex. Rubber comes from the rubber tree and it is quite flexible. In fact, the stretchy quality of latex and rubber is very desired for some articles of clothing. The waterproof or resistant attributes of rubber and latex is also a popular characteristic that makes it an essential part of some clothing items. But the problem with rubber and latex is that it is not a very comfortable fabric to wear. You really do not want to dry clean rubber clothes either. The chemicals in the dry cleaning process can damage or ruin the fabric. When elastic is combined with polyester or other thread types, it is usually at the center of the construction and its duties are restricted to bringing the clothing item back to its original shape. Elastic fabric 3: Spandex- this elastic material can expand to 300 to 400 percent of its original size. Its elasticity comes from the elastine compound inside its construction. How Elastic Fabric is Made Bands of rubber, latex, and other stretchy materials are woven together to make a very stretchable fabric. This fabric is then combined with other flexible ones to make the clothing item stretch. The stretch reach of the elastic fabric can go in two ways. First, there is the 2-way stretch that has the fabric stretching in only one direction. This can be either lengthwise or crosswise. The second way elastic stretches is 4 ways. This means that the fabric can stretch both lengthwise and crosswise. Also, you can stretch the fabric sideways or along the selvedges. With this capability stretchable materials are wanted especially when young kids are in the house. The elastic nature helps protect the clothes from being stretched out of ","149 shape and ruined after only a few uses. Stretch fabric 4: Knits- most knits stretch 2 ways with some exceptions that allow it to go 4 ways. This stretching ability makes it a popular fabric to use in making clothes. You can find this fabric in several varieties. Elastic Material For Clothing There are a lot of choices in this category. The use of elastic is innumerable as so many clothing items can benefit from the added elastic in their construction. The different styles of elastic have different purposes. There is pajama, underwear and lingerie style which is soft because it comes in direct contact with the skin. Then there is baby elastic that is used primarily in baby clothes. This style is heat resistant and has a lot of stretch to it. Normally it returns the clothes to their normal shape. Also, there is elastic swimwear. Not only does it resist heat, it can stretch to 3 or 4 times its size. It also resists damage from chlorine, saltwater and sunscreen. Then you have sports elastic which resists sweat and many washings. It is tough as it has to retain its original shape. Braided elastic has a long lifespan normally. It is also built for heavy use. Knit elastic is soft and comfortable while cord elastic is used for jewelry and clothing that does not stretch a lot. Finally, there is buttonhole and drawstring elastic. The former works well with maternity clothes and the latter for expanding waistlines. Elastic fabric 5: Spandex blends - there is a whole long list of this type of elastic material used in fashion. It is popular because the blends work well. ","150 When Was Elastic Invented for Clothing? Like cotton, elastic has a long history. Although that story is not fully known its use has gone back thousands of years and has enjoyed a long life span. The American Indian used rubber long before Columbus appeared. Their word for the material translates into weeping tree. Then the Mayans used to mix the juice from different vines to create an early form of elastic band that bound different items together. But for modern elastic inventions we only have to go back about 200 years. Thomas Hancock is credited with inventing elastic in about 1820. His invention started with elastic closures for gloves as well as elastic for shoes, suspenders and socks. During his experiments he found that he was wasting too much rubber so he invented a machine called the masticator to conserve the rubber material. It is not known who originally invented the rubber band, but it was done in the mid- 19th century. In 1923, William Spencer was the first to mass-produce rubber bands. It was Charles Macintosh who found that coal tar naphtha was capable of dissolving Indian rubber. This led to his being the first to make waterproof clothing. How to Weaken Elastic The way to weaken elastic is to stretch it far beyond its stretching ability. Once the material goes beyond that point of no return it is too weak to be of any elastic good. The elastic really can’t perform like it could when it was its original size. The way to stretch elastic past that point of no return is to stretch it out over an ironing board. Then use a hot iron to apply the heat. As it heats, stretch it out, then let the elastic cool. At this point, it may be too stretched to function like it is supposed to. This same process works for waistband elastic as well. Another way is to stretch the elastic out and keep it stretched out for a day or two. ","151 Elastic Fabric Types We have already listed the 5 main elastic fabrics that you should encounter throughout your sewing career. The one fabric we did not go into any specifics was the spandex blends. That is because there are a lot of them. Cotton and polyester are just two of those blends. The former only needs about 3 to 5% spandex to be stretchy and comfortable. Then there is the satin and velvet blend and both of these styles help you make very nice looking clothing articles. Nylon goes well with spandex and this blend is usually found in swimwear, sports bras, cycling shorts, and other activewear clothing. Rayon and spandex provide a silk-like look when combined together. It's a stretch to keep you from being uncomfortable. Stretch denim makes jeans, etc. very comfortable as cotton, poplin and spandex blend does for a variety of shirts. Fake leather and vinyl combine with spandex for belts and home furnishings, etc. Honorable mentions go to stretch lace, Powernet, acetate/spandex, modal/spandex, Tencel/spandex, and linen/ spandex. There are a lot of spandex blends available that are not mentioned in this list. Elastic Cotton This can be a very expensive fabric to use. It costs more than polyester elastic and similar synthetic blends. The cost is why you have to be careful about how you use it. There is a risk to using this blended fabric which if used wrongly may cost you dearly. Cotton elastic is very absorbent, and it is very soft. It should feel good against your body when you have it on. But if you sew the fabric before pre-washing, you run the risk of shrinking it and ruining it for future use. You can use this fabric for neckwear, pants, swimwear, and sweaters. Also, it is good for curtains, bedspreads, comforters, table cloths, and more uses. Plus, you can machine wash, hand wash or send it to the dry cleaners. You have a lot of ways to get the material clean. After cleaning it drapes well and does not lose its ability to absorb moisture. ","152 Nylon Stretch Elastic This fabric has a lot of uses but its specialty is in marine and outdoor areas of life. The braided nylon elastic is very good at resisting fires and is used in a variety of automotive areas. Also, nylon stretch elastic is quite strong. It may be the strongest of all elastic type blends. It is so strong, it is used for tough activities like boating and other outdoor activities. It is machine washable, yet it does not float. Once it is created the cost is quite high, but it is a very high-quality fabric to use. Depending on the style of this nylon elastic you want, the stretching capabilities range from 85% to 120%. When you want real durability, you turn to this fabric to get your sewing project done. Polyester Elastic This is a very popular fabric for 2 reasons. It is the most versatile and the least expensive. Those two elements are always very attractive. It is so popular and useful that you will find it throughout the medical or health care practices. Also, it is used in most wash and wear clothing lines. The durability of this fabric means that it is very hard to shrink. Plus, it resists mildew and bleach. That makes it a very healthy material to use as often as possible. There is a melting factor that is involved with this fabric. But the good news is that the melting point isn’t reached till the temperature hits 450 degrees F. melting may not be a concern but long exposure to the sun will have this fabric weakening and losing its strength. You have to be careful with this fabric when it is not cold outside. Depending on the style of polyester elastic, you can get between 110% to 125% stretch out of it. ","153 Some Final Words Elastic is a great option to combine with your favorite fabrics. Not only does it help their longevity, but your clothes can also retain their shape for a long time to come. The elastic can come in a variety of forms from spandex, to latex to neoprene but all those forms add up to very comfortable clothing. The only elastic compound that is not comfortable in clothing is rubber. That is why it is saved for specific applications like scuba diving and similar activities. But no matter how you use elastic, you get a good clothing ingredient that does nothing but positive for your clothes. Label The label is an important part of a garment. A label is more than just a piece of fabric, which directly communicates with the customer. It’s something like that drawing the full attention of the customer. Also describes what the product quality actually is. Based on the label, the customer decides whether he/ she buys the garments or not. So, a label has great importance in selling the garment. This article has presented various types of labels used in garments. Definition of Label: A garment label is a communicator between the buyer and the product. A garment label contains various types of information about that garments, such as buyer name, country of origin, types of fabric, types of yarn, fabric composition, garments size, special instructions about care, etc. Without any type of label, a garment cannot be sold in the foreign market. Types of Label used in Garments: There are mainly two types of label and these are- ","154 ● Main Label, ● Sub Label. Those are discussed below: A. Main Label: The main label contains the Brand name or Brand logo of the buyer such as H&M, American Eagle, Nautica, etc. The brand name is an important factor for any product. Because the customers are targeted by the Brand during buying any product. A Brand name is a mental satisfaction about the product from the customer’s point of view. The main label is totally certified in the right quality of the brand. B. Sub Label: Sub Label is not a label by itself but it includes different types of labels. These are in the following: ● Care Label, ● Size Label, ● Price Label, ● Composition Label, ● Special Label, ● Flag Label. All kinds of Sub Labels are discussed in the following: 1. Care Label: ","155 Care label is another important type of the label for the garments. It assists the customers to know how the product should be cared for. It indicates different types of care instruction about the garments such as Washing, Bleaching, Drying, Laundering, and Ironing, if it can be maintained in a directed way, then the garments will achieve higher durability and garments shade will be perfect for its highest period of time. 2. Size Label: Size label indicates the size of the garments. Size labels are indicated as S, M, L, XL, where S for small, M for medium, L for large, and XL for extra large. 3. Price Label: The price label indicates the price of the garments. ","156 4. Composition Label: The composition label indicates the fabrication and composition percentage of any garments. That means it indicates which fabrication (Cotton Sub denim, Cotton Regular denim, etc.) and composition percentage (95% Cotton 5% Spandex, 100% Cotton, etc.) have followed during its manufacturing. 5. Special Label: Sometimes the buyer is advised to use the special label in the garments to attract the customers to their items. Special labels are 100% silk, 100% Cotton, and 100% Leather, etc. 6. Flag Label: The flag label is a very small label that contains the brand name or Brands logo of the buyer. It is attached to the side seam of the bottom parts of the clothing. 7. RFID Label: Radio frequency identification (RFID) tags are a substantial part of everyday life and the use of the technology continues to grow. Radio frequency identification (RFID) tags are a substantial part of everyday life and the use of the technology continues to grow. ","157 Consider the label on a bottle of alcohol at the store meant to discourage stealing or the small device/sticker on a car windshield that allows fine-free toll road use: those are all RFID tags. While most RFID tags are used for merchandise or to track packages, they can also be used to help track pets or patients in hospital settings. What Are RFID Tags and How Are They Used? RFID tags are a type of tracking system that uses radio frequency to search, identify, track, and communicate with items and people. Essentially, RFID tags are smart labels that can store a range of information from serial numbers, to a short description, and even pages of data. Some RFID tags include cryptographic security features for a high level of verification and authentication. RFID tags are usually identified by their radio frequencies: low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and ultra-high frequency (UHF). LF systems have a range between 30 and 300 KHz and a read range up to 10 cm. These systems are more frequently used in applications like access control and livestock monitoring. HF systems have a range between 3 and 30 MHz and a read range from 10 cm to 1 m (3 ft). These systems are commonly used for electronic tickets, payments, or user experience applications. UHF systems have a range between 300 MHz and 3 GHz and a read range up to 12 m (39 ft). These are the systems most commonly used in retail inventory tracking, parking garages, door access, and asset management. ","158 Passive vs. Active RFID Tags There are two types of RFID tags — passive and active. Passive RFID tags are the most common; they do not require a direct line of sight to a reader but do have a much shorter read range, and are smaller in size and lightweight. Passive RFID tags are ideal for: ● Supply chain and inventory management ● Asset and personnel tracking ● Logistics ● Industrial and manufacturing ● Brand protection and anti-counterfeiting ● Real-time location systems (RTLS) using 3D orientation insensitive design ● Gate and perimeter access control ● Pharmaceutical and healthcare ● Entertainment and travel ● Apparel and retail Active RFID tags are less common and require their own transmitter and power source. These tags tend to be bulkier, rugged, durable, and more expensive. An example of an active RFID tag is a beacon used for RTLS, constant medical monitoring, or theme park attendance. What Is NFC Technology? A subset of HF RFID, near field communication (NFC) technology connects the Internet of Things (IoT) and can be used for more complex, secure interactions. The communication between an NFC tag and an object can go both ways, making everyday objects smarter and more trustworthy. NFC is limited to HF, close- proximity communication and only one NFC tag can be scanned at a time. NFC is incredibly simple to use and since most mobile devices are now NFC enabled, it typically does not require any additional infrastructure to adopt the technology. Identiv’s RFID Tag Portfolio RFID tags allow businesses to run efficiently with little cost and positive results. ","159 There are multiple options, including physical access cards, inlays, tags, labels, or touchless solutions, and adding tamper functionality can transform an RFID tag into a smart seal. Identiv’s portfolio offers a wide range of RFID solutions for any application imaginable — it even includes Eco-Friendly RFID Tags that boast the lowest carbon footprint in the industry. Stopper/Cord lock/Cord fastener/ Plastic stopper/Spring clasp/Cord toggle A plastic cord lock (also known as cord fastener, plastic stopper, spring clasp or cord toggle) attaches to drawstrings and tightens without the use of knots. Cord locks allow mountaineers to fasten clothing and camping equipment quickly in cold conditions when the fingers are encased in heavy gloves. They consist generally of three parts: a barrel, a toggle (plunger), and a spring. Squeezed together, tension is released and the cord lock can move freely up and down the cords. Released, the tension is engaged and the cord lock stays in place. They come in many sizes and shapes to suit any purpose, including plastic cord lock, mini size cord lock, no spring cord lock, spring cord lock, with rim cord lock. Cord fasteners are used in many different applications to retain one or more cord segments or drawstrings in a tightened condition and to release such cord segments when desired. For example, cord locks are used in connection with garments that include drawstrings, such as hooded jackets and sweatshirts. ","160 Such fasteners are also used on various types of bags such as laundry bags and other storage bags that utilize cords to temporarily close an open end. They are also used in window blinds. They vary in size depending on the particular application, from 1–3 inches (25–76 mm) long. One of many variations of a cord lock was invented by Mark J. Krauss in 1986. Hang Tags Hangtags are the labels attached to clothing which usually contain the basic information about the item. Size, price, brand… all this can be found on the hangtag. But what is now becoming more prevalent in the industry is the practice of using hangtags as another weapon in the battlefield of marketing. Too often the branding of labels and tags is an afterthought. Europe is leading the way when it comes to the utilization of tags. Hang Tags can help you and your brand in several different ways. From brand recognition through to increased website visits, taking the time and the effort to work your hangtags can reap massive rewards down the line. Why Are Hang Tags Important? Stand out on the rack Products, especially garments in crowded retail stores, can easily get lost on the racks. Having a distinctive hangtag that’s strategically attached to your product can make it stand out from the crowd. A distinctive logo, bright colorful designs, or even a strange and unique shape; these are all things which draw attention, and as a result, make your product stand out from the rest and help customers identify your product. Help customers invest in your brand ","161 By using a hangtag to share your brand’s unique story, you allow customers to become attached to your brand, and to foster a sense of loyalty. This is especially true in the case of eco-conscious, locally made, or one-of-a-kind pieces. Explain your mission statement and fair trade policy on a hangtag, and this will allow customers to feel part of something bigger. People are becoming more and more environmentally conscious and are happier to pay extra if there’s a good reason to, but they need to see that reason! Give easy access to care and pricing information Presenting this information on the hangtag makes your brand feel more transparent and helps your customer make an informed purchase. Many of our clients’ pricing strategies account for the cost of ethical materials and their own labor, making their products appear pricier than mass produced products in the same store. Asking a fair price (alongside your brand’s story) can help educate customers on the true cost of consciously designed products. If there’s too much information for the space available, then a QR code will allow customers to go directly to a webpage, where you can explain in detail exactly what has gone into the product they are holding in their hands. Promote your business Think of a hangtag as a business card. Use it to not only sell the product it’s attached to, but to advertise your business at the same time. Print information on there that draws people to your website. Advertise your social media channels like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. Use the hangtag to offer discounts on the customer’s next purchase. It’s an opportunity for promotion as well as simply communicating basic information. Material for the garment hang tag ","162 ● Paper material hang tags; ● Metal material hang tags; ● Leather material hang tags; ● Textile material hang tags; ● PVC plastic material hang tags, rubber, wood. And all kinds of mixed materials are ideal for garment hang tags. 1. Paper material for the garment hang tag They include coated paper, special paper, Kraft paper, single-faced and double-side paperboard. Insulating and corrugated paper, cardboard, recycled paper, etc are in their scope. Further, paper materials are perfect for garment hang tag. In addition, they are the common materials in the process. 2. Metal material hang tags They include copper, iron, alloys, stainless steel, etc. Apart from this, metal materials are suitable for clothing tags on denim clothing. Thus, it can be a chain material for hanging clothing tags to highlight its style. 3. Leather material of garment hang tag It includes all kinds of animal skin, fur, leather, etc. Besides, leather materials are ideal for hang tags on leather and denim clothing. And it aims to illustrate the material of the clothing itself. ","163 4, Textile material hang tags The material includes canvas, silk, chemical fiber, and cotton fabrics, etc. But, the fabric hang tags are perfect for leisure clothing and hang tag strings. So, it is good for people’s skin. 5, Other materials There are many other materials for clothing hang tags. As PVC, rubber, wood, and all kinds of mixed materials. Therefore, they are great for garment hang tags to improve brand value. Eyelets Eyelets are a small hole or perforation that is used as a fastening, with a cord or hook. Usually the eyelet is set with a metal, cord or fabric ring. The ‘little eye’ ring reinforces the hole and prevents it from stretching, while the small eye is for threading lace, string or rope through. Eyelets can be either functional or purely for decorative purposes. ","164 Velcro / Velcro hook and loop fastener Technical progress does not stand still, and every day in the world there are various discoveries in a particular area of human activity. Some inventions get used immediately; others remain unclaimed for a long time. Textile fastener is an innovation that was a breakthrough in the clothing and footwear industry of the XX century. Earlier, zippers, hooks, buttons, and various types of lacing were used to fix items of clothing and shoes, which were not always distinguished by convenience and practicality. The progressive invention of the Swiss designer The history of the invention of textile fasteners goes back to the middle of the last century, when the Swiss engineer George de Mestral (1907- 1990) came up with the idea to look through the microscope of the burdock head. Multiple zooming allowed the scientist to see miniature “hooks” with which the plant clings to animal hair. After examining the properties of the «sticker» which so vexed his dog during his walks, the inventor thought about the possibility of using this biomimetic property for practical use. A few years de Mestral went to his discovery, which was preceded by a lot of trial and error. As a result, in 1955, an engineer received a patent for his invention - a textile fastener made of nylon, which has been actively used in many industries and national economies. How does it work? The production technology of textile fasteners is based on the principle derived from the observation of wildlife. Burdock inflorescences are spherical baskets in a ","165 \"wrapper\", the surface of which is covered with a set of microscopic hooks. George de Mestral noticed this plant feature and created a fundamentally new type of fasteners, consisting of two tapes. The “sticking” effect is achieved by hooking micro hooks into micro-loops. The result is a fairly strong compound, which is one of the most successful examples of biomimetics. Unbelievable, but it is a fact! A kind of “burdock” fastener with the greatest tearing force of 5-6 cm2 is capable of supporting an adult’s weight (provided that the load is evenly distributed). In order to quickly separate the parts of the textile fastener, one should move as if tearing off a sticky tape starting from the free edge. In standards such actions are called exfoliation. In industrial conditions, textile fasteners are made from nylon, since the structure of this material is considered to be the most successful for “drawing out” micro-hook. At the same time, the \"fleecy\" part can be a woven, knitted, knitted fabric. Why Velcro? Textile fasteners are often called Velcro, tape-contact, hook & loop, touch fastener, Velcro, etc. In fact, the name \"Velcro\" is a registered trademark of the manufacturer in 1961, which was one of the first to launch the industrial production of textile fasteners. Today, the company supplies its products to many countries and confidently holds the position of a market leader. Permanently high quality, variety of product positions, constant updating of the product catalog is the secret of this brand’s success. The Dual Lock fastener (registered trademark of 3M Company) in its properties and principle of action is similar to Velcro fasteners. Clutching of two elements occurs according to the “fungus-fungus” principle. On the inside of both ribbons there are miniature plastic mushroom-shaped pins that “cling” to each other. Along with the numerous advantages of this type of fasteners there is one major drawback - the lack of flexibility. Dual lock elements are used more in the construction industry, as well as in the implementation of interior solutions, when non-heavy objects should be attached to the walls of the room. The main types of Velcro textile fasteners and the scope of their application ","166 Textile fasteners of the Velcro Company and other manufacturers are actively used in the clothing and footwear industry, medicine, construction, aviation, astronautics. “Stickers” has long been firmly established in our life and is the usual detail in the design of casual clothes and shoes. Soft tapes and Velcro panels are great for fitting curved surfaces. Fastening of elements in places of bending goes without problem. Currently on the market there are such varieties of \"stickers \": ● Stitched - most demanded among consumers. They differ in size, density of the nylon base, the load capacity, the location of the hook and fleecy parts. For example, on ring type buckles, both elements are placed on the surface of one tape; ● Self-adhesive - have a special adhesive base; ● For hot fixing - fixed to the fabric with an iron; ● Special (interior Velcro, etc.); ● Metal \"stickers\" - used in the construction industry, can withstand loads up to 35 tons per 1 square meter! When attaching Velcro panels to the fabric with the help of thread seams, it is not recommended to cross the working surface with suture lines, if the reduction of load capacity is not provided in the technological requirements. Interesting to know! Velcro panels are actively used on the International Space Station. Under weightless conditions, it is rather difficult to fix one or other objects, but a solution was found. The walls of the station compartments are plastered with \"fleecy\" elements and on tools, stationery and other items used by personnel, elements with “hooks” are attached with the help of a sticky backing. Textile fasteners in the form of tapes of various widths in many cases act as a worthy alternative to zippers and buttons. The most popular are elements with a width of 20, 25, 30, 50, 100 mm. ","167 Use of Velcro “stickers” when sewing tactical clothing and equipment Textile fasteners are actively used for sewing army uniforms, tactical equipment and accessories. Such elements are able to provide: ● Quick adjustment of harness position, plate carriers, drop leg thigh platform, LBE (Load Bearing Equipment); ● Reliable fixation of the closing flap of cartridge pouches, backpack pockets, EDC (everyday carry) Bags, organizers, etc. ● Fastening to the components of tactical equipment of special insignia, etc. Textile fasteners are able to withstand significant loads and demonstrate high rates of tensile strength, minimize the load on the material at the places of fastening which prevents deformation of the woven base. Flexible tapes do not hamper movements, which makes them a good solution for equipping equipment and clothing used in field conditions, when performing tactical and combat missions. Opening / closing of a textile fastener takes a split second, which in extreme and close to extreme situations becomes especially important. The original Velcro fasteners which we use in the production of tactical clothing and equipment, elements of modular systems, plate carriers, bags and backpacks, are durable, reliable, and have no manufacturing defects (the company values its reputation and puts textile fittings under strict control at all stages of production). Buying products from the Ukrainian brand Velmet Armor System you can be sure in excellent quality of materials and accuracy of compliance with the technology of tailoring. At the same time, the cost of our products is lower than that of imported analogs, and is available for a wide range of consumers! ","168 Drawstring A drawstring is material threaded through a casing, used to cinch or close something. They are used in sweatshirt hoods to help them fit snugly, in the waistline of garments as an alternative to elastic or a belt, and as means of closing and securing any kind of fabric sack, such as a purse or duffle bag. Sports pants in jogging suits or sweatsuits, and medical pants, also called scrubs, are two popular garments in which one commonly finds a drawstring. When used to cinch the waist of a garment, it may either be partly visible as part of the garment's exterior design or threaded invisibly inside the garment. Many different narrow fabrics can serve as a drawstring, including cord, braid, leather, ribbons, and strips of fabric from which the garment is made. When the garment is being constructed, either a safety pin or a tool called a bodkin is used to pull the string through the casing. An external drawstring may be fastened by tying it in a bow or fastening it with a buckle, depending on its function, while an internal one is made to be tied. Even with precautions, such as tying the ends of a drawstring before putting a garment in the wash, or making small knots in each end that will prevent it being pulled completely inside, the cord will occasionally get \"lost\" in a garment or even break. If you remove the old drawstring, using a large safety pin or a bodkin if you have one, you can rethread the casing with a new one. Bags that use drawstrings for closure include sports backpacks for carrying gear from the locker room to the athletic field, fashionable purses, satchels, beach bags, holiday gift bags, duffel bags, and coin pouches. Since it is not the most secure or complete closure, you will find that some of these items use the drawstring only as an ornament, and that even if it is functional, some have a secondary fastening system, such as a snap or zipper ","169 Twill Tape Twill tape is a type of fabric tape that is woven in a twill pattern, meaning that it has parallel diagonal ribs. This woven pattern is extremely sturdy, making the tape a very popular sewing notion; twill itself has been woven for centuries. Most sewing stores carry this tape, typically in an assortment of colors, weight grades, and widths, to satisfy a range of sewing needs. It is also possible to order it directly from manufacturers; this is advised if you have a major project and you want a cheap bulk rate. There are all sorts of uses for twill tape. It is often used, for example, to make sturdy ties on things like hospital gowns. It can also be integrated into seams to reinforce them, or used for trim. Many sewers use it to make tags, since the tape will hold up through years of use without being scratchy, and some conservators use the tape to label things like ancient textiles, since the tape will not react with the materials used in the textile. A variety of materials can be used to make twill tape. Cotton tape is very common, as is polyester, but wool, linen, and even silk may be used in some regions. Many companies make “naked” tape, meaning that it is undyed, while others produce a range of colors and sometimes patterns as well. Widths typically vary, allowing people to use very slender varieties for projects like ties, and wider ones to reinforce heavy seams and the like. Most companies also make lightweight and heavy duty twill tape for specific tasks. Depending on the material used to make twill tape, it can often easily be dyed another color. People can also paint or stencil patterns onto the tape, along with other information such as a catalog number or a seamstress' name. In some regions, people also embroider the tape, as it holds embroidery very well. The sturdy weave also resists distortion, ensuring that patterns remain true to their designer's wishes. The quality of twill tape can vary, with especially cheap tapes being prone to raveling and running dyes. If you aren't sure about the quality of a piece, you may want to ","170 test a sample for colorfastness before you throw it in the wash, as running colors can stain garments. It also helps to tightly sew down the ends of a strip of it to reduce traveling. USES FOR TWILL TAPE 1. Split side seams I love the look of split side seams on sweatshirts and T-shirts, it just adds such a lovely little detail. Using twill tape here gives such a clean finish to the split side seams on both the inside and outside. 2. Stabilize seams This is quite common on store bought T-shirts and helps to stop the shoulder seam getting stretched out of shape over time. It is especially helpful for seams that are cut on the bias of lightweight stretch fabrics. 3. Bag handles Wide twill tape is a great option for bag handles and straps as it is so sturdy and strong. I love the contrast of the twill tape against the knitting in this knitted tote that Meg of Elsie Marley made. 4. Drawstring Twill tape is perfect to use for drawstring on waistbands and cuffs. You need to fold over the ends about 1cm twice and then sew them down. It would also work well for drawstring bags or anywhere else you might want to use drawstring. ","171 5. Tags and labels Plain twill tape can be used for tags for holding up tea towels and pot holders. It is also suitable for handmade clothing, for example add a loop to the back of a jacket for hanging it up or sew a folded piece into trouser to indicate the back. You could step it up a notch though and add your own designs to create clothing labels. There are many techniques you could use to do this, such as stamping with fabric paint or using transfer paper. 6. Bunting (Binding) In some cases twill tape can be used instead of bias binding. It works particularly well for bunting – just fold the twill tape in half, sandwiching the fabric triangles in between, then sew in place. 7. Accessories There are so many different ways you could use twill tape for accessories. Turn it into a hair accessory organizer, layer some in a photo frame for an easy way to display pictures, make keyrings or garlands. 8. Make casings Since twill tape is durable and doesn’t fray you can sew it down to form a casing for drawstring or elastic. Don’t forget to leave a hole to insert those though. 9. Decorative ","172 Use twill tape anywhere you would use regular ribbon – sew it onto clothes for decoration, use it to add details such as tabs on sleeves or wrap gifts with it. The options are endless here, you just need to use your imagination. 10. Sturdy ties Twill tape is ideal for strong ties – for aprons, hospital gowns or even cables. STITCH What is Stitch in Garment? Stitch is very important during manufacturing a garment. Stitch can be defined as, one unit of conformation resulting from one or more strands or loops of thread by intra-looping, inter-looping, and interlacing. The stitch quality is measured with stitch size, stitch length, width, depth, tension, sequence, elongation, elasticity, resilience, fabric distortion, yarn severance, and abrasive strength. Types of stitch There are different types of stitch used in garments; those are mentioned in the following: ● Class-100 (Chain Stitch), ● Class-200 (Hand Stitch), ● Class-300 (Lock Stitch), ","173 ● Class-400 (Multi Thread Stitch), ● Class-500 (Over Edge Stitch), ● Class-600 (Covering Chain Stitch). As per Decathlon: ● 301 (Lockstitch) ● 301/2 (Lockstitch) ● 304 (Zig Zag Lock Stitch) ● 308 (Zig-Zag-3 Lock Stitch) ● 401 (Chain Stitch) ● 401/2 (Two needle chainstitch) ● 401/4 (For Needle Chainstitch) ● 406 (Coverstitch/Interlock - 2 needle, 3 thread) ● 407 (Coverstitch/Interlock - 3 needle, 4 thread) ● 504 (Overlock - 3 t ● hread) ● 514 (4 thread overlock) ● 516 (5 thread overlock) ● 602 (Cover stitch/ Interlock, 2 needle 4 thread) ● 605 (3 needle, 5 thread Coverstitch/ Interlock) ● 607 (Flat Lock) ","174 Stitch Glossary As per decathlon: - Stitch Code Remarks/brief description Needle & Thread Image 301 Lock Stich, Single Needle Lock Stitch m/c 1 needle thread, 1 bobbin thread 301/2 Lock Stitch, 2 needle Lockstitch m/c 2 needle thread, 2 bobbin thread ","175 304 Zig-Zag Lockstitch, Zig Zag Machine 1 needle thread, 2 bobbin thread 308 Zig-Zag 3 Lock Stitch, ZigZag m/c 1 needle thread, 2 bobbin thread 401 Chain Stitch, 1 needle chain stitch m/c 1 needle thread, 1 looper thread 401/2 Chain Stitch, 2 needle chain stitch m/c 2 needle thread,2 looper thread ","176 401/4 Chain Stitch, 3 needle chain stitch m/c 4 needle thread, 4 looper thread 406 Coverstitch/ Interlock; 2 needle, 3 thread interlock m/c 2 needle thread, 1 bottom looper thread 407 Coverstitch/ Interlock; 3 needle, 4 thread interlock m/c 3 needle thread, 1 bottom looper thread ","177 504 Overlock; 3 thread overlock m/c 1 needle thread, 2 looper thread 516 Overlock; 5 thread overlock m/c 1 needle thread,1 bottom thread, 2 looper thread 602 Cover stitch/ Interlock; 2 needle 4 thread coverstitch m/c 2 needle thread,1 spreader thread, 1 looper thread ","178 605 Cover stitch/ Interlock; 3 needle 5 thread coverstitch m/c 3 needle thread,1 spreader thread, 1 looper thread 607 Flat Lock; Flat Lock m/c 4 needle thread,1 spreader thread, 1 looper thread ","179 Chain Stitch The stitches in the Chain Stitch Family are looped stitches. This means that they are made by looping the stitch around the needle. The various ways in which this is done makes a great many variations. This is one of the biggest family of stitches. The Chain Stitch is good to work on seams and combine with embellishments. Chain stitches are also used in making tambour lace, needlelace, macramé, and crochet. In machine sewing, Chain Stitch was used initially, which was replaced by a more secure stitch later. The oldest sample of Chain Stitch has been identified from the tomb of the Egyptian pharaoh, Tutankhamun. ● Chain Stitch is the basic and simplest stitch of the Chain Stitch family. It gives a chain like an appearance or, like petals lined up one after the other. Chain Stitch is one of the oldest known stitches that has been used widely among various cultures from Asia to Europe. ● Whipped Chain Stitch:Done over a foundation of Chain Stitch, this stitch gives a whipped appearance and looks best if done with a contrasting colored thread. ","180 ● Double Chain Stitch: This stitch follows the same technique as a simple Chain Stitch. The only difference between the two is that a double chain stitch is done over two parallel stitch lines, instead of one. Thus, in the end, the visual effect is that it looks more or less like an Open Feather Stitch. To be able to do this stitch, it is good if you are aware of the Chain Stitch technique. ● Magic Chain Stitch: This is a little tricky for the first time doers. So be careful not to twine the threads too much in the process, and keep slow pace and patience. Magic Chain Stitch is a wonderful stitch, which uses two (or more) colors alternately to form the chain sequence. ● Lazy Daisy: This is often used to give petal designs and small floral patterns. It consists of a single loop of chain than a continuous pattern. Lazy daisy is one of the extremely easy stitches. This stitch need not be limited to just petals and leaves but can be used for more ","181 complicated designs too. ● Russian Chain Stitch: As the name suggests, this stitch is found in Russian embroideries, usually along with the basic chain stitch. It is made by grouping together three lazy daisy stitches, in a clover shape. Ideally, the first Lazy Daisy loop would point upward. Since this is a motif stitch, it is good for borders. So, when you make horizontal borders, the stitches are placed one on the side of the other with the first Lazy Daisy pointing upwards. When doing a vertical border, they all fall below one another, but again with the first lazy daisy pointing upward. ● Long Tailed Daisy: This stitch is similar to Lazy Daisy. I would say it is a different version of Lazy Daisy. The only difference being that this has a longer ‘tail’ which contributes to its different look. ● Feathered Chain Stitch: This stitch looks like the long-tailed daisy done in a zigzag manner. Being a motif stitch, it can be used comfortably for light borders and with other embellishments. You need to be aware of the Long- Tailed Daisy stitch to be able to do this stitch. Knowledge of the Zigzag Chain ","182 Stitch will be good. ● Basque Stitch: This stitch originated from the Basque provinces of northern Spain. Basque Stitch has been found in old embroideries from these areas of Spain, southern France, and Portugal as well. This stitch was used along with Basque Knot (of the Palestrina Family of stitches). Traditionally, Basque Stitch was done with a red thread over green fabric or white thread on a blue-green background. ● Petal Chain Stitch: This stitch is done from right to left…or, better to do from right to left. ● Reverse Chain Stitch: This stitch is visually not very different from the usual chain stitch. The difference is the direction in which these stitches are done. If a Chain Stitch is done from bottom to top, reverse chain stitch is done from top to bottom. You would require to know the Lazy Daisy Stitch to be able to start the Reverse Chain Stitch. ","183 ● Heavy Chain Stitch: As the name suggests, this is a heavy or thick looking chain stitch. It gives out a rich feeling, depending on the thread used to stitch. Like the Reverse Chain Stitch, this also follows a reverse direction. I will be stitching from top to bottom on a curvy stitch line. To do this stitch, you need to be aware of the Lazy Daisy Stitch. ● Braided Chain Stitch: The Braided Chain Stitch is worked almost the same way as the Heavy Chain Stitch. There is only a slight difference in the way the needle is taken under the existing loops, thus giving it a totally different and embossed look. It follows a reverse pattern like the Reverse Chain Stitch and so we work it from top to bottom. ● Zigzag Chain Stitch: This stitch is the incorporation of Chain Stitch in a zigzag manner. In other words, the Zigzag Chain Stitch is done between two parallel lines instead of one. Ideal for any border embroidery, this is more of a decorative stitch. ","184 ● Cable Chain Stitch: Cable chain stitch is different from the usual chain stitch in a slight way. This stitch has each of its loops connected by a small ‘cable’, instead of being connected directly with each other as in Chain Stitch. ● Twisted Chain Stitch: In this stitch, each loop in the sequence will look like the ‘red ribbon’. To achieve this, we always put in the needle on the left of the previous stitch point. This slight ‘dislocation’ of the needle towards the left twists the base of each loop. ● Raised Chain Band: This stitch, as the name suggests, is a series of chain stitch loops made over rows of straight stitches. It has a raised effect and used in embroidery types like Stumpwork. It looks nice if contrasting threads are used, and it makes nice border stitch. It can also be used as a rich filling stitch by doing multiple rows of chain stitches over a broad row of straight stitches. ● Checkered Chain Band: This stitch is a little complicated, but not too difficult to learn. Here, we use two different threads to make chain stitches over a foundation row of straight stitches. So, the visual effect would be an embossed magical chain stitch. Multiple rows of checkered chains can be done over a broader foundation of straight stitch to give a chessboard appearance or a filling effect. For the sake of this lesson, though, I will be doing only one row over a narrow foundation of straight ","185 stitches. The knowledge of magic chain stitch could be helpful, though not a must. This stitch requires more patience I feel since we are dealing with two colors of thread using two needles, alternately, in the same journey. LOCK STITCH Source: Science Direct A lockstitch is the most common mechanical stitch made by a sewing machine. The term \"single needle stitching\", often found on dress shirt labels, refers to lockstitch. Class 300: lock stitches The lockstitch class 300 is the most commonly used, as a complete garment can be sewn on a lockstitch machine. These stitches are formed by a needle thread or threads, introduced from one side of the material, interlacing with an under- thread supplied from a bobbin on the other side. Applications of lock stitches include seaming operations on all types of garments and run stitching. Lock stitch is extensively used for joining fabrics collar, cuff, pocket, sleeve, facing etc. Lockstitch type 301 is the simplest, which is shaped from the needle thread and the bobbin thread. ","186 The class 300 lockstitch is often referred to as a double lockstitch. It is formed by interlacing a single-needle thread supply with a bobbin thread supply from underneath, and has great strength and resilience if the correct types of thread, i.e. polyester/corespun, are used. Lock Stitches are very secure, as a break in one stitch will not cause the seam to unravel, although it will compromise the overall seam performance. Lockstitch is the most widely used stitch in low-volume production. Lock Stitches are used for: ● Comfort/stretch garments, because the stitch can extend by up to 30%. ● Fabrics where it is important to have the same appearance on both sides. ● Top-stitching collars, cuffs, etc., because this is the only stitch that sews reliably around 90° when the fabric is pivoted at the needle point. OVERLOCK STITCH An overlock is a kind of stitch that sews over the edge of one or two pieces of cloth for edging, hemming, or seaming. Usually an overlock sewing machine will cut the edges of the cloth as they are fed through (such machines being called sergers in North America), though some are made without cutters. The inclusion of automated cutters allows overlock machines to create finished seams easily and quickly. An overlock sewing machine differs from a lockstitch sewing machine in that it uses loopers fed by multiple thread cones rather than a bobbin. Loopers serve to create thread loops that pass from the needle thread to the edges of the fabric so that the ","187 edges of the fabric are contained within the seam. Overlock sewing machines usually run at high speeds, from 1000 to 9000 rpm, and most are used in industry for edging, hemming and seaming a variety of fabrics and products. Overlock stitches are extremely versatile, as they can be used for decoration, reinforcement, or construction. Overlocking is also referred to as \"overedging\", \"merrowing\", or \"serging\". Though \"serging” technically refers to overlocking with cutters, in practice the four terms are used interchangeably. Overlock Presser Foot While the overlock stitch can be sewn with a standard zigzag presser foot, it works best in conjunction with an overlock or overcast foot, which is specifically designed ","188 for this stitch. Why the special presser foot? An overlock foot has a guide bar that allows you to sew right up against the edge of the fabric, so the zigzag portion of the stitch swings off the fabric, enclosing the raw edge. This is what makes it look professionally sewn. Without the overlock food, your stitching will run parallel to the edge of the seam allowance—not enclosing it. You can cut the excess fabric off, but no matter how close you trim it, it won’t look the same as if you’d used an overlock foot. COVER STITCH A coverstitch is formed by two or more needles which add straight stitches to the fabric and a looper thread on the opposite side of the fabric that zig-zags between the straight stitches. A coverstitch results in parallel lines of straight stitches on one side of the fabric and an overcast stitch on the reverse side.: 159 It is widely used in garment construction, particularly for attaching trims and flat seaming where the raw edges can be finished in the same operation as forming the seam. ","189 Uses Unlike the overlock stitch which is sewn over the edge of the fabric, the coverstitch can be formed anywhere on the fabric. The coverstitch is useful for necklines and hems, particularly in knits as the stitch will stretch. When the straight stitches are on the visible side of the garment, the looper thread on the reverse hides the raw edges of the fabric. On some garments, the coverstitch is used with the looper thread on the visible side of the garment for emphasis or decoration.: A twin needle on a regular sewing machine can be used to imitate a coverstitch by sewing parallel straight stitches on the top side and a zigzag stitch on the reverse. Standards The distance between the needles determines the distance between the lines of straight stitches. Home machines generally offer a narrow setting of 2.5 or 3.5 mm, and a wide setting of 5 mm. Some of the newest home machines permit a 4-thread coverstitch which results in three lines of parallel straight stitches. The International Organization for Standardization classifies stitch types in ISO 4915:1991. ISO 406 describes a two-needle coverstitch and ISO 407 a three-needle coverstitch. Machines Single-purpose coverstitch machines are used in industry sewing. In the 1990s, the functionality to perform a coverstitch was added to some home sergers. Most major sewing machine brands also offer stand-alone coverstitch machines for home sewing. ","190 FLAT LOCK A flatlock is a seam which ensures that two pieces of fabric stay together. A ”normal” seam can start to irritate your skin. This happens because two layers of fabric are connected by a single thread which causes some overlap between the two fabrics. The overlap causes irritation, and that’s why flatlock stitching is mostly used on sportswear. Because sportswear moves back and forth across the skin. A flatlock seam does not have this side effect because it is a flat seam. An important feature is that the ends of two pieces of fabrics are exactly connected to each other with a flatlock seam. This means that you don’t have to deal with an overlap of two fabrics. That’s the reason why we always suggest flatlock stitched sportswear. FASHIONABLE Beyond the effectiveness, a flatlock can also be fashionable. Because the seams lie on the clothes, you can play with the color of the threads. In the picture below you can see how a white flatlock looks on a pink fabric. Try it yourself and tell us which flatlock color you want on your clothes. Our designers are ready to fulfil your wishes:). Differences between Coverstitch & Flat Lock ","191 A coverstitch is basically 2 or 3 needle bobbin-less top stitching that provides some elasticity. It doesn’t have to be used on an overlocked (serged) seam but usually is. The back side of the seam forms a ladder pattern or similar configuration joining the lines of stitching to and fro. This is similar to the effect you’d get on a home sewing machine with a double needle. The latter differs from a true double needle because these have two bobbins so their lines of stitching are not joined on the back side from side to side. Below is a drawing of a coverstitch seam on the left with photos of an overlock on the right. There are various models, this one attaches ribbing and cover stitches in one pass. For this reason we also covet coverstitch machines, perhaps more than flatlocks. A flatlock is different in several respects. Unlike an overlock, there are no layers to the underside, the seam is butted together (exceptions exist). On a flatlock, there is no seam allowance with layers folding to the underside. Think of it this way, in the application you’re describing there is no seam allowance per se because the cut edges of fabric are butted against each other and joined flat in a single layer with thread. The flatlock stitching on the top and bottom joins the two butted pieces. LINING Lining Garments lining have functional and consumer appeal objectives and this section will examine the principles involved, starting with the material itself. Linings are generally a functional part of a garment, an accessory. They are available as warp knits but they are predominately woven and are made from polyester, polyamide, viscose for use where a slippery material is required and from cotton and wool mixtures where decoration or warm handle is required. Lining material can be used for small parts – pockets and for complete garments, either fully bagged out. It can be used in coats, jackets and raincoats, body and sleeve, for ladies items such as blouses, frocks etc. ","192 Objects Of Lining ● To maintain the shape of garments. ● To improve hang and comfort by allowing it to slide over other garments. ● To add insulation. ● To cover the inside of a garment of complicated construction to make it neat. ● They are selected to match the garments to be unobtrusive. ● To add the design of garments. Fiber Types And Properties Of Lining Today natural fibers are rarely used to construct linings due to high cost and some difficulties with imparting a suitable finish to fabrics. Synthetic fibers are now the most widely accepted for garment linings, and the following describes the main properties of those which have the most widespread use in the clothing industry. Viscose Viscose is made from cellulose which is derived from wood pulp, and like most other synthetic fibers, it goes through a number of chemical and mechanical processes until the filaments are ready for spinning into yarns. Linings constructed from viscose fibers have strength, luster, softness and affinity for dyes. Rayon Originally rayon was produced as a cheap substitute for silk and the fibers were known as ‘artificial silk’. Rayon linings have similar properties to those of viscose but are somewhat weaker. Polyamide Derived from nylon, polyamide produces linings with excellent tensile strength and a relatively high degree of elasticity, and it takes dye-stuffs very well. A drawback with polyamide linings is that some solvents used for dry cleaning can have a detrimental effect on the fabric. Polyester Polyester fibers are closely related to polyamides and linings made from polyester fibers have many similar properties. The first polyester linings had a tendency to soften when pressed with a hot iron, but fibers with a high melting point have since ","193 been developed and these withstand regular pressing temperatures. Other than some polyamide linings, none of the linings made from these synthetic fibers are harmed by dry cleaning and they can be safely pressed up to a temperature of 170o C. Functions Of Lining Garment linings have a number of functional purposes besides their main one which is to cover all or part of the interior surface of a garment. These other functions include: ● As linings have a sheer surface, putting on or taking off the garment is a smooth and simple action. ● Linings help to preserve the shape of skirts and trousers made from loosely constructed or stretchy materials. ● Garments such as dresses, skirts and trousers, made from diaphanous materials, sometimes need ‘cover up’ areas. Linings do this job well. ● Some types of outerwear materials have a tendency to cling to the body and this can spoil the silhouette of the garment. A layer of lining between the body of the wearer and the top cloth will usually eliminate this problem. ● Linings are often used to assist in the formation of design features on garments. For example, the difference in lengths between the body shell and the body lining creates the blouson effect. The same principle is also used to create an ‘overhang’ look on puffed sleeves. Consumer Appeal Of Lining An important factor of consumer appeal is to present a garment whose inside has an attractive appearance. The surface and luster properties of the lining have a considerable influence on this, and those properties for linings most widely used are: Taffeta: A crisp fabric woven with a faint warp pattern which produces a shiny surface. These linings are generally piece-dyed which helps to soften them and make them able to withstand normal washing and dry-cleaning process. Crepe: Made from specially processed yarns, mostly viscose acetate, the finished surface of this lining has a minute and uniformly crinkled appearance. ","194 Satin (sateen): This lining is characterized by a smooth and highly lustrous surface and a dull back. Satin is the name of a weave pattern and all-cotton fabrics that were once constructed with this weave pattern were called sateen. Color also plays an important role and linings with a woven, printed or embossed pattern can give an extra fillip to a garment. Some large companies incorporate their logo in the weave pattern of their linings. The Selection Of Linings This is not a simple matter because the properties of different linings overlap to a considerable extent and usually there is little difference in their prices. Apart from considering price, the designer should always work with reputable suppliers who can supply particle proof of the specific properties of their linings. Failing that, a sample length should be requested for trying out in the factory. Very cheap linings should be avoided if possible because if they do not cost much it is likely they are not much of a lining either. Making Up And Testing Of Linings Lining materials fray easily and should be assembled on a four-thread safety stitch machine. Although thread consumption is greater than on a regular sewing machine, the seam produced is superior. Irrespective of whether linings are pressed or not before setting, all vertical seam inlays should be pressed to one side. Apart from making the presses work a little easier when finishing the garment, this helps to prevent ‘seam-grin’ which could happen if the seam is left to find its own lay direction, or even worse, if the seam is pressed open. Where the body linings are pressed as one unit with the cloth, the shrinkage factors of the cloth and linings should be checked to verify that the two materials have compatible shrinkage in the width and the length. If the discrepancy is substantial, it would be worth substituting a different lining because working with linings which have excessive shrinkage could lead to complications during production and finishing. The most practical test for a lined wash and wear garment is to wash a garment, using the correct program, in a domestic washing machine and check the outcome ","195 after the garment has been dried and pressed. Although pinking is sometimes used to finish the hems of skirt seat linings and knee-length trouser linings, these hems will eventually start to fray after moderate wear and cleaning. Consideration should be given to finishing these linings with a double-turn hem in order to prevent fraying and consumer dissatisfaction. Fleece and quilted linings should be assembled with a five-thread safety stitch machine having a wide bight. The seam produced is stronger and has more extensibility than with a four-thread machine – two properties essential for this types of linings. Lining Component Patterns Grain line markings are as necessary for linings as they are for top cloth and fusible. They should match the grain lines of the relative cloth components, although this can be ignored for components such as sleeve linings and linings for skirts and trousers, which are sometimes cut across the piece instead of in the length. Linings rarely have a pile direction and the up and down arrangement of the components for one size is a standard procedure in the industry. However, it is always safer to check this, especially with sateen, patterned or brush finished linings. If the lining does have a definite direction, this has to be indicated on the pattern. The number of nips on lining patterns should be kept to the minimum because every nip is a potential weak spot on the seams. In addition, if the nips fray out before sewing, the assembly operator will have to skirt round the frayed areas by sewing wider seams than those called for. Despite the fact that linings are sometimes referred to as secondary material, they have an important functional and consumer appeal role. Therefore the selection, patterns, cuttings and making-up of linings should receive the same levels of treatment as those accorded to the top cloth. Types of Lining - Pros and Cons Silk, viscose, acetate, polyester and rayon are among the most popular fibers used for lining materials. In many ways, the fiber type is the key factor: it influences the way your lining feels to the touch, the way it sews and drapes, its breathability and – last but not the least – the price point. Below are the types of lining cloths available on the market: ","196 Natural Fibres Silk Lining ● Can be soft or smooth ● Can be sheer, semi- sheer or opaque, matt or shiny ● Good for skin ● Can be too hot in summer ● Not very durable ● Sensitive in care ● Expensive Cotton lining ● Soft ● Breathable ● Not static ● Good for skin ● Machine washable ● Not slippery ● Wrinkles easily ● May shrink Wool lining ● Warm and insulating ● Breathable ● Soft ● Can be itchy ● Too warm for summer ● Sensitive to care Viscose and rayon lining ● Breathable ● Static-free ● Silky soft ● Drapes well ● Not strong when wet ● Wrinkles easily ● Can shrink in the wash Artificial fibers Cupro lining ● Smooth ● Satiny shiny ● Breathable ● Static-free ● Takes up stains easily ● Not strong Acetate lining ● Less shiny than polyester ● Breathable ● Builds static ● Prone to ripping and fraying ● Wrinkles easily ● Less absorbent Synthetic fibers Polyeste r lining ● Soft and shiny ● Strong ● Wrinkle-resistant ● Cheap ● Machine washable ● A somewhat plastic feel ● Can be static ● Not breathable ● Keeps the odours ● Too hot for summer ","197 INTERLINING Interlining is a layer of textile used between two outer layers of shell fabric to impart strength, support, stability and shape retention to the outer shell fabric against any distortion due to stress exerted at various stages of production, during wearing/use or aftercare treatments. The interlining is also called interfacing. Difference between interlining and lining The lining is a layer of textile used under the garment as cover to the raw edges and smooth surface to support the outer shell for good drape. It can be woven or knits as needed for a particular application/use. For example, in the girl’s frock, you will find white lining fabrics under the shell fabric. As said above interlining is used between two outer fabric layers. For example, fusible interlining used in collar and cuff in men’s formal shirts for stiffening the said components. Why interlining? Followings are the primary objective of using interlining in garments. Interlinings are primarily used for imparting strength/support, stability and shape retention. When fused to the outer shell fabric it acts as a composite and stabilizes the outer shell against any distortion under stress Helps improve aesthetic and hand feel of fused laminate Helps retain the shape of the fused part during use and after care treatment Improves longevity of fused part Different types of interlining available/in use Interlining can be classified into different types based on: ","198 a) Based on the base fabric structure interlinings are categorized into 3 types: ● woven interlining, ● knits interlining and ● nonwoven interlining b) Based on its application point, interlinings are categorized as non-fusible or fusible 1. Woven interlining Primarily woven interlinings were first used 100 years ago to strengthen/support coats, cloaks and gowns or hats. It was mainly 100% cotton fabrics made stiff by starch application and was non-fusible. However, the unpleasant hard touch and irregular characteristics during washing led to the development of fusible interlinings. Normal cotton sheeting fabrics were applied with a layer of adhesive that can be fixed to the shell fabric by application of heat or pressure. This formed a composite part of the fused shell part and supported the outer shell for better drape and look. Woven interlinings are majorly 100% cotton based with a thread density of variable count as required for the weight or stiffness needed for a particular use. Now poly- cotton blends are also available to overcome the problems of shrinkage faced in cotton fabrics together with a variety of warp and weft combinations like rayon, textured poly and wool etc. Advantages of woven interlining The main advantage of woven fabrics is its strength and stability, hence used for all such applications where strength and stability are needed like the waistband. However, this could be a disadvantage at times where flexibility and soft hand feel is required. Woven is majorly plain weaves, sometimes crepe, herringbone or twill weaves are also offered according to the application need. ","199 In such cases, textured poly yarns are used for voluminous body, soft and natural hand feel or drape of the fused composite at the same time strength, flexibility and lightweight of the fused laminate is achieved without much altering the natural drape or texture of shell fabric. However, woven is expensive and not suitable for less expensive casual garments hence, it was replaced by knitted fabrics that used a combination of synthetic yarns with rayon and wool for body and volume according to different applications intended for. 2. Knitted interlinings The major disadvantage of woven in its flexibility, lightweight and soft handle was duly addressed by knitted fabrics. Knitted fabrics have a large number of variations in terms of loop structures to impart flexibility/stretch together with the body (volume) and strength/stability. They keep the lightweight and soft hand feel of the laminate by using fine bulked (texturized) filaments. It is expensive and hence used in high value garments like blazers and high fashion blouses. 3. Non-woven interlinings As the name implies there is no involvement of any yarn for interlacement to make the fabric. It is made directly from fiber to fabric stage in the process reducing the cost of base fabric. As there is no yarn used in making nonwovens, it lacks in strength needed for apparel use and there are many techniques applied to impart required strength to nonwoven textiles, called Bonding. They are the most versatile product available from 10gsm to 200gsm and above, offering light, soft, flexible or strong for any application one can think of. The basic manufacturing technique is using mostly synthetic fibers to form a layer, which are imparted strength by bonding. Let us understand the different layering and bonding methods, their use and their advantages and disadvantages: ","200 Layering Method: Different types of layering methods (spun laid, wet laid, dry/random laid, cross laid, and linear laying) are shown in the following images. Bonding Method: Advantages and Disadvantages HD-PE-ADHESIVE ","201 Advantages Disadvantages Good bond-strength on a wide range of fabrics No steam fusing capability No reaction to steam no steam included strike-back No high-frequency fusing capability Good dry cleanability (A)* Requires high fusing conditions Excellent washability (950C), suitable for garment dyeing, etc. Heavy contamination of taflon belts HD-PE-ADHESIVE Advantages Disadvantages Adequate bond-strength for small-area fusing Hardening of the handle due to surface scatter coating Low reaction to steam, low level of steam-included strike-back No high-frequency fusing capability Easy to fuse with hard-ires Adhesive strike-through passible as this, lightweight outer fabrics Adhesive weakened during dry cleaning can be reactivated by repressing No dirt on roller/thread ","202 PA - ADHESIVE Advantages Disadvantages Good bond-strength on a wide range of outer fabrics Bond-strength sometimes inferior on synthetic outer fabrics and fabrics with special finishes Melting point lowered by steam Strong reaction to steam, possibly disadvantageous with low melt adhesives Good dry cleanability to all solvents Tendency to steam-included strike-back No contamination of teflon belts on continuous presses Washable only to 40C with MV adhesives How to select the right interlining for my use? To help decide on the type of interlining suitable for an application, one has to evaluate the exact need, purpose, the material area of application, the care instruction and processing details of the garment. The following FORMAT is suggested to be filled in and one may consult an interlining supplier to conduct a fusing test on the material, preferably on self- owned equipment in the factory and submit a test report for 5, 10 or 20 washes depending upon the brand value and price point of the garment. ","203 Fabric Sample Based on the above information, the interlining manufacturer will submit the test results showing: ● Samples after fusing and after 5, 10 or 20 washes for appearance, hand feel reference. ● Bond strength values after fusing and after washes. The buyer can decide if the results and looks are acceptable or not. If left to choose, then one can decide based on: ● Appearance: no bubble or any surface unevenness after wash. ● No change in hand feels making it too hard. ● No change in visual looks: wavy moiré effect or color change (please refer to picture NW 10). This is due to woven interlining or linear dot print pattern used in light open texture fabrics (see picture NW). ● No shiny dots of glue visible on another side. ● Normally for very light, transparent and flimsy fabric like georgette/chiffon color of interlining must match the base color and not use white/black/charcoal in general. For small area usage as mentioned which are close stitched from all sides the bond value of 5-7 N per 5cm strip is enough and safe. ","204 UNDERLINING In short, underlining is a layer of fabric underneath your main fabric, that you treat as one with the main. With underlining, you essentially create your own 2-ply fabric. It's different to lining, as lining is like a separate unit that is only attached to the main in a few key areas. Why underline? Different reasons for different fabrics: ● You may want to underline if your fabric is a loose weave or unstable and you feel it needs the extra support to hold its shape. ● Your fabric may be sheer and you want to it be more opaque. ● You may want to change the properties of the fabric to be stiffer or heavier. ● You may want to add warmth to your fabric by adding a thermal layer! This fabric was slightly sheer, which meant you could see through the fabric enough that another layer underneath it would show. This fabric was far too beautiful to not give it the finest treatment, so I opted for an underlining. More work, but a lovely result. The tips I will share will be focused on the techniques used for this garment. The benefits underlining gave this dress: Pocket bag: Of course, I needed to keep the lovely slash pockets. But I definitely did not want the pocket bag showing through the skirt as a white blob! Lining behind the pocket could help counteract this, but I decided that for the ultimate, it needed ","205 an underlining (which provides a layer BETWEEN the skirt and the pocket) so that the skirt was fully opaque. Neck facing: The neck facing was the same issue. I did not want a white circle around the neckline! Darts + seam allowances: And of course, pressed darts would form a white triangle that could show through to the front of the dress. The same goes for any seam allowances. Skirt:Underlining the skirt also gave the bonus of modesty (no visible underwear, please). What not to underline Tip: Only underline where necessary - there is no point spending all the time and fabric on underlining places that don't need it. Also, before you underline, think about whether a lining would serve you just as well. Linings are generally easier as you do not have to attach them all together around the edges. Facing in Garment Construction? A facing is the area of a garment or sewn item that turns to the inside, giving a finished appearance to what would otherwise be a raw edge of the fabric. The facing is usually interfaced to add shape to the edge of the fabric and help the garment maintain the desired shape. Understanding the different types of interfacing and how they work is an important aspect of sewing facings. In some cases, another layer ","206 of the fabric itself is used as interfacing. Location Common facing areas on garments are necklines (without a collar), armholes in sleeveless garments and waistband-less waistlines. Peek a boo type garment openings usually also have a facing. When you are following a pattern, the pattern directions are your first source of assembly instructions. In most cases, the facing pieces are assembled or sewn together and then attached to the garment to finish the raw edge of the garment. The inside edge of the facing, the edge that is not attached to the garment, is finished in a seam finish type of method to prevent the facing from fraying. In many cases, the edge of the facing is sewn with a single line of stitching to help the facing hold its shape and then the raw edge is trimmed with pinking shears to prevent fraying. This type of edge treatment is done so the facing does not have a \"bulging\" edge that might be seen through the garment. The facing should have a seamless transition from the outside of the garment. A facing should always stay inside the garment. When attaching a facing, the pattern provides dots, notches, and seams that should line up with the same parts on the facing. Seams must intersect properly for the facing to lay properly. Once a facing is attached, grading the seam and understitching a facing helps the facing stay turned inside the garment and provide a professional finish to the way your facing looks from the outside of the garment. Assembly and Care Many garments sold in stores do not have facings, but rather finished and turned edges. Bias tape edging is often used as a facing inside newer patterns instead of ","207 fabric facings. To stitch down the bias tape, a line of stitching must be visible on the outside of the garment, which changes how the garment edge lays. Full facings or bias tape facings are required depending on the garment and the desired result. A facing pattern piece is a small and commonly lost pattern piece. You should take care to refold and package your pattern after dining if you wish to use it again. Buying a whole new pattern is expensive and may not even be possible if the pattern is discontinued. To prevent fraying, a seam finish is applied to the raw edge of a facing. Avoid heavy turned edges on the edge of the facing that will show through the garment. Most facings will require you to tack or slip stitch the facing to a seam allowance or inside part of the garment to assist the facing in staying inside the garment. This stitching is not sewn to the main body, but only to things like seam allowances, so the \"tacking\" is not visible on the outside of the garment. ","208 SEAM SEALING A tent/raincoat with leaky seams is no fun, especially amid that afternoon downpour. But a tent’s seams are also its most vulnerable zone to rogue and insistent water. To prevent infiltration, raincoat manufacturers have three options: seam taping, seam sealing, and creating a strong seam construction itself. Seam Tape Seam tape is a layer of tape—technically, a polyurethane film—that is placed under the seams to block any water that enters the needle holes from making its way into your tent. The tape acts like a dam. Seam taping can only be done at the factory because it requires a special machine, and each type of fabric demands an exact temperature for application. Tent factories are typically certified to apply seam tape. You might be familiar with the seam tape on your waterproof jacket. In tents, the method is similar, but the way it’s integrated is different. Seam Sealing Seam sealing, on the other hand, is like applying a layer of glue—or sealant—across the seams. 1 LAYER SEAM SEALING TAPE 1 Layer Seam Tapes are an excellent solution for breathable and non-breathable coated and laminated fabrics along with similar property based materials that require tape sealing application. Because it is such an excellent solution for these types of fabric, 1 layer seam sealing tape is commonly used for fashionable rainwear, Ski and Snowboarding clothing and workwear that requires seam sealing to ensure a strong level of waterproofing. ","209 1 Layer Seam Sealing Tape is of particular benefit for performance clothing because it is both lightweight and flexible. This allows it to work perfectly with sports outer layer clothing that is in the light to medium weight category of sports performance clothing. With excellent adhesion bonding properties for fabrics, 1 layer seam sealing tapes can create a 100% waterproofed seam. 1 layer seam sealing tapes offer a low cost solution for clothing production needs, especially where price point is of great importance. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Tape is seam sealing tape that is used for medical protective clothing and equipment to help seal seams and ensure that the clothing, apparel or protective suit being worn is completely secure and the occupant is protected. PPE Seam Sealing tape has become a vital tool in the protection of medical personnel in the fight against the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak of 2020 but before the global pandemic, PPE seam sealing tape was consistently being used in the medical industry as an effective way of protecting doctors, scientists and nurses from bacteria, virus and other dangerous biohazards that would otherwise pose a health risk to the wearer. 1 layer seam sealing tape can be used for disposable protective clothing used in PPE clothing solutions. 2 LAYER SEAM SEALING TAPE 2 layer Seam Sealing Tape (also known as Double Layer Seam Sealing Tape) is a commonly used heat tape applied over fabric sewn seams to prevent water transfer and air passing through. 2 Layer Seam Tapes are an excellent solution for the seam sealing of a waterproof membrane. This makes them an ideal solution for high performance outdoor clothing including waterproof jackets and waterproof trousers. Our 2 layer seam sealing tapes help to lock in the seam and prevent water and air penetration. On a rain jacket for example, this helps to make the garment both waterproof AND windproof rather than just weather resistant. ","210 Why does a garment seam need seam sealing tape? Whether a seam joint is between a jacket sleeve and the jacket's main body panels or two panels of a camping tent (for example), it still creates an easy entry point that water and wind can penetrate. To prevent this weathering element from entering, seam sealing tape can be applied to seal up these vulnerable stitch holes and make the fabric seam waterproof. Ideal for high performance waterproof clothing designed to protect the wearer from high winds and heavy rain. With an excellent adhesion to fabrics, 2 layer seam sealing tapes have become a commonly used solution to create a 100% waterproofed seams for outdoor clothing. You can also find 2 layer seam sealing tape used on various levels of PPE solutions. 3 LAYER SEAM SEALING TAPE 3 layer Seam Sealing Tape is the thickest, heavy duty seam sealing tape that we manufacture in our current tape range. 3 layer Seam Sealing Tape is similar to a 2 layer seam sealing tape but with a thicker, more heavy duty design that makes it ideal for use in more demanding environments such as military application, biohazard protective suits, the automotive industry (for the likes of car seat seam sealing and dashboards), dry and wet suits and PPE Clothing. While 1 Layer Seam Sealing Tape is ideal for lightweight, performance clothing and 2 Layer Seam Sealing Tape is a firm favorite for the outdoor clothing sector, 3 Layer Seam Sealing Tapes is commonly used when durability and heavy wear are of great importance. A 3 layer seam sealing tape helps to lock in the seam and prevent water and air penetration. With an excellent adhesion to fabrics and a heavy duty construction, this seam tape will commonly be used on heavy wear areas of clothing as well as on heavy duty garments. This makes it an ideal solution for military application. Beyond garments & PPE Seam Sealing Tape is not used exclusively in the clothing sector. Seam Sealing Tape is commonly used in car interiors to help provide a strengthening element to car ","211 seats as well as sound insulation on dashboards. Hidden behind your dashboard, seam tape is an invaluable part of the car manufacturing process. HEAT SEALING Heat Seal Label: In garments manufacturing it’s called heat seal or heat transfer label which shows the company’s brand logo or other important messages. Heat seal label is very attractive to a customer so its quality should be first class and label attaching process is very sensitive.Label attach by pressure and heat that’s why it’s called heat transfer Label. Parameters Influence the Fastness of Heat Transfers: ● Temperature ● Pressure ● Time ● Design / placement of artwork ● Quality of glue ● Work requirement before and after heat transfer operation Guidelines for Heat Transfers Storage of Heat Transfer Label ● Heat Transfer must be stored in a cool and dry place, away from direct sunlight below 24 C (75 F) and humidity below 70 %. ● As all heat transfers have a shelf life, it is recommended to use heat seal transfer within 12 months from the date of production. Requirements of the Application Equipment / Heat Transfer Presses: Only automatic pneumatic machines which are able to apply transfers piece by ","212 piece must be used. Roller transfer press machines and manual presses are not accepted, as they cannot guarantee correct and consistent application. Heat Transfer Presses must have the following features: ● Pneumatically operated with adjustable time, temperature, and pressure. ● Digital microprocessor controller for time and temperature accuracy. ● Fingertip controlled operation and programmable print settings. ● Digital timer, adjustable which shows time countdown on readout, beeps after elapsed time and resets when the handle is raised. ● Consistent, fully adjustable pneumatically pressure control, with pressure range of at least 0 – 7 bar (0 – 100 psi / 0 – 7 kg / cm2) ● Working temperature range of at least 70 – 230 C (160 – 455 F) ● Display Time Range of at least 0 – 180 seconds ● The Head plate should be made of metal and Teflon coated to prevent soiling which could contaminate the garments. ● The base plate must be made of silicon rubber or can be a fleece platform with sufficient resilience to ensure close alignment with the upper heat press platen. A fleece platform is recommended to use for the application of 3- dimensional heat transfer. ● Platen size should be at least 38 x 38 cm (15” x 15 “) ● The plate should be bigger than the artwork. ","213 CHAPTER 2: QUALITY ","214 Every garment buyer has its own quality manual or procedure, a standard quality procedure should be maintained in the garments manufacturing industry to reach up to the mark in quality control. Every person related to apparel manufacturing needs to know about garment quality procedures, especially for them who work in the quality department. Here I wrote all the general garments quality control procedures of Garments manufacturing from cutting to finishing that’s how we do to maintain quality procedures. GARMENTS QUALITY CONTROL PROCEDURES 1. Checking fabrics, trims, and accessories as per buyer requirement. 2. Make size set sample and review in PP meeting. 3. Pattern correction based on size set garments measurement. 4. Cut 300 pcs as a pilot run from all size range after PP meeting to ensure all size measurement is correct then proceed to cut for bulk. 5. Keep a pattern library of a printed pattern in the CAD room. 6. If fabric shrinkage differs more than 2 %, a different pattern will be made. 7. Ensuring that fabric with accessories as per consumption is okay to proceed bulk then start cutting. 8. Cutting will be started after buyer QC approval of bulk cutting. 9. Ensure all cut panels should be double-check with pattern & maintain your record as per SOP. 10. All cut panels to be quality inspected before inputting to the sewing section. 11. Checking fabrics bonding strength with interlining after fusing, fusing attached temperature record with thermal paper. 12. Keeping Go by sample for every running style to confirm garments styling is accurate as per sample. 13. Ensure all marking instruments should be invisible especially pen & chalk mark pencils use light mark but it should be erased on a daily basis, follow up oil leakage from the machine by put blotting paper or fabric under the pressure foot, also double check all the machine inside have any extra needle by the magnet. 14. Ensure all machine tension with feed rock is set up properly by our actual fabric quality on a daily basis & keep a record with mock-ups. 15. Needle control and Needle change record maintenance properly.. 16. 100% garments quality inspection in both sewing and finishing. 17. 100% garments to be measured in finishing. 18. Button pull test checking and record daily. ","215 19. Garments pass through a metal detector machine. 20. Keep packing accuracy as per buyer approval, check daily and take buyer approval for folding and packing. QUALITY CONTROL CHART ","216 Fabric Defects When we talk of defects, it is generally a fault which spoils the quality of material. Faults in Fabric results in reduction of its cost as well as reduces its value in the market from consumer point of view. A Fabric Defect is any abnormality in the Fabric that hinders its acceptability by the consumer. Importance: ● With an increase in demand for quality fabric now customers are more concerned about the quality of the material. ● In order to fulfill demand for quality material it is important to avoid defects. ● A significant reduction in the price of fabric is seen due to the presence of faults. ● It also affects the brand name. Here, I want to show some fabric defects that should be detected during inspection. Defect Type & Brief Description Image Missing yarn:Occurs in circular knit. Caused by one end of yarn missing from feed and machine continuing to run. ","217 Dent Mark Water Mark:Water spots are usually caused by wet fabric being allowed to remain too long before drying, Color migrates leaving blotchy spots. Fold mark/Scrimp: Scrimp is the result of fabric being folded or creased when passing through tender frames. ","218 Loom Bar Bias & Bow/ Bowing & Skewing: Bowing is a condition in woven textiles where filling yarns are displaced from a line perpendicular to the selvages and lie in an arc across the width of the fabric. Bowing appears as rows of courses or yarn-dyed stripes forming a bow shaped curvature along the fabric width. Skewing is a similar condition in which filling yarns are angularly displaced from a line perpendicular to the edge or side of the fabric. Bowing and skewing affects striped or patterned fabric quality more than for solid color fabrics, as the greater contrast in patterns makes the distortion more prominent. Causes and prevention of bowing and skewing: Bowing and skewing can be caused by an ","219 uneven distribution of tension across the fabric width during dyeing or finishing processes. Improper stretching during scouring, dyeing or finishing might also cause bowing or skewing. Correcting the tension settings on processing machines should rectify these defects. You can also ask your supplier to fix bowing and skewing found during fabric inspection by reprocessing the fabric through a compactor or straightening machine. Pen Marks Double Pick ","220 Miss Pick Stains Mark:Stains are fairly common among dyed textiles and are defined as spots or patches of differing color. Textiles are never truly safe from stains because they can occur anytime during or after production if they’re not kept in an area with adequate protection.fabric defects.Stains can appear on fabrics from just about any source. Dirt from the factory floor, oil from machinery and dyes are all known sources. Stains are relatively easy to identify and prevent so long as suppliers are vigilant about fabric quality. Causes and prevention of dirt/stains: Your manufacturer can prevent stains during production by regularly cleaning production machines and equipment to ensure no random oils, grease or dyes make their way onto the textile. Wrapping the finished rolls of fabric in plastic and storing them in a separate area away from the dying area can help avoid post- production stains. ","221 Yarn Pull Crease Mark:A crease mark is a visible deformation in fabric. A crease mark differs from a crease streak, as it’s unlikely to appear for an entire roll. Rather, it appears in just one spot on the fabric. If final pressing cannot restore fabric to the original condition, a crease mark will be left on the final product. Discoloration can also be a problem associated with this fabric defect. Causes and prevention of crease mark: Crease marks often happen when fabric passes through squeeze rollers in the dyeing process. Creasing is inevitable as fabric is fed through machines in rope form. But if properly handled, crease marks should not be permanent. ● Inadequate preparation, relaxation or bulking of fabric ● Poor quality of fabric: a tight construction, high twist yarns or dense weight ● Poor suitability of machine: not moving folds properly ● Incorrect loading of fabric into machine, resulting in twisted or knotted rope ● Excessively rapid heating or cooling ","222 rates Along with rectifying these issues, using anti- crease agents during the scouring process prior to dyeing can help prevent crease marks. Foreign Yarn Slub:Slub refers to thick or heavy places in the yarn or flying waste yarn getting into yarn feeds during the spinning process. Slub and other inconsistencies are common in fabrics produced on vintage shuttle looms. ","223 Hole:A hole is an imperfection where one or more yarns are sufficiently damaged to create an opening in the fabric. holes are typically treated as a major defect in the fabric and are assigned either two or four penalty points during fabric inspection, depending on their size. Causes and prevention of hole Holes are usually caused by an accidental cut or tear to the fabric. Broken needles or rough mechanical parts are common culprits for fabric tearing during manufacturing. Prevent future holes by ensuring your supplier has procedures in place to regularly check needles and machinery prior to production. Abrasion Mark:An abrasion mark is a discolored area damaged by friction or rubbing. fabric defectsAbrasion marks are sometimes also referred to as chafe marks or bruised places. Causes and prevention of abrasion marks: Chafing or impact with a hard or rough surface usually causes abrasion marks. For instance, scratches on the breast beam of the loom might cause chafing. Abrasion resistance is the ability of a fabric to withstand surface wear and rubbing. Fiber, yarn and fabric properties and finishing processes are the main factors that determine abrasion resistance. Using fabrics that are more abrasion resistant can help reduce abrasion marks. Nylon is generally regarded as having the best abrasion resistance, followed by polyester. ","224 Cut Piece Dyeing Spot: Dye marks are irregular patches on the surface of raw textiles. Dye marks are typically the result of:fabric defects ● Low quality base fabric ● Improper leveling agents ● Incorrect pH in the production process ● Dye machine entanglement Causes and prevention of dyeing/printing/dye marks: To prevent dye marks, make sure the base fabric is free of problems before stitching. Any issues missed will be present in later production processes. Other preventative measures include maintaining the correct pH level, using an appropriate dying agent and using a backup power generator to ensure production machines don’t shut down during use. ","225 Fabric Joint Line Mark Soil mark ","226 Damage Coated Damage Shade Bar ","227 Broken Ends Rib Missing Knots:Knots are caused by tying spools of yarn together. ","228 Oil Mark Yarn Contamination Spot Mark ","229 DEFECTS OF TRIMS ","230 Garments Quality Check Points and Their Quality Control Garments QC/QA Check Points: Each of the four sections of garments quality control can generate defects in manufacturing, such as cutting, sewing, washing, and finishing, and there must be some criteria to measure the quality of garments products. Section wise Garments Quality Check Points ❖ Cutting quality Check Points ❖ Sewing Quality Check Points ❖ Washing Quality Check Points ❖ Finishing Quality Check Points Garments Quality Check Points and their Checking Criteria: Here is a section wise quality checkpoint description for your better understanding as mentioned every work of garments quality control department. Cutting Process Quality Check Point ● Fabric upside down: Make sure the fabric is not upside down. ● Fabric Skewing: A maximum skewing of 2 cm for the chest of 60 cm is acceptable, but not more. This defect can be solved by re-setting of the fabric at the fabric mill. ● Relaxation: Before cutting, knitted, elasticized woven fabrics should be suitably relaxed for around 12~24 hours or more, depending on the type of fabric. Relaxation is mandatory for stretch fabrics. ● The height of the cutting pile: The higher the pile on the cutting table, the more chance the cut pieces are unequal in size. This can lead to size specification & fitting problems. Make sure the height is suitable for the type of fabric (usually 2~3 inches and never more than 5 inches). ● Numbering and bundling: Make sure the different parts are properly ","231 numbered to avoid shading and that this numbering can be easily removed after sewing is complete. ● Storing: Make sure the different parts are properly stored, for example, rolled, and not folded. Sewing Process Quality Check Point Critical operations: Check all critical operations repeatedly (like the sewing of the neck- seam, armhole, cuff, placket, etc.), so the operator gets the clear input of what is required and how to make it correctly before large quantities of garments are finished. ● Attaching label should be correct as per the size of 100% garments ● Checking bonding strength of interlining in the fusing process. ● Seam allowance: check operators repeatedly on this point to make sure they use the correct seam allowance. ● Numbering: Make sure the sewing operatives keep parts with the same number together to avoid shading. ● Confirm Garments styling construction and measurement are correct as per the approved sample. Washing Process Quality Check Point ● Washing method: normal wash, stone wash, sand wash, or enzyme wash. ● Bleaching method: stone bleach, garment bleach ● Any special process. E.g. over-dye after the washing process ● The color tone of the blue yarn ● The whiteness of the white yarn ● Resultant color tone: bluer or yellowish ● Rubbing effect: contrast on the blue yarn and white yarn ● Evenness on the blue and white parts ● Hand-feel ● Record the identification of the sealed sample, quality standards on the final inspection report to ensure QC checks the bulk according to the correct standards. ● Tick and sign all quality standards as an indication of proper QC checking. ● QC should not release the shipment if they find the following major faults. ● Color out of the approved shade band ● Fabric flaws and washing marks in excess of 1″ on the garment zone above the ","232 knee ● Fabric flaws and washing marks in excess of 3″ on any part of the garment Finishing Process Quality Check Point ● Button attaching and button Pressing ● Full Garments quality check ● Packing and carton Button Attaching and Button ● Snap button too loose / too strong ● Snap button not closing properly / broken ● Missing poly washer for snap buttons ● Button coming off ● Fabric not strong enough to hold the button ● Mark from molding ● Paint damaged ● Rust ● Text on button not straight ● Wrong position / not in line with counterpart / incorrect spacing ● Button shank missing when required ● Buttonhole too big or too small ● Buttonhole not clean / badly stitched/ losing shape / stitched with wrong thread quality ● Spare button missing or put in the wrong position Check Pressing ● Shiny marks ● Not pressed or improperly pressed ● Should avoid the press and fold the pigment-dyed fabrics before garment washing entirely. It is because it will leave a clearly visible mark on the garment after washing. After sewing, put the garments on a hanger until washing starts. Full Garments Quality Check ● Checking full garments workmanship defects ● Measure 100% garments to assure fittings ","233 ● Heat seal peeling off ● Confirmation quality check of final garments product Packing and Carton Quality Check ● Correct ticketing and placement ● Packing accuracy of quantity, assortment, and folding ● Correct carton selection as per customer requirement ● Packaging, sealing, binding and barcode checking ● Final Inspection Quality Check Points After completing carton, Garments buyer QC does a Final quality inspection, evaluating final product quality. Quality Inspection Criteria are of Final Audit: Final Audit or inspection is the most important factor for a garment factory. Final Audit is the final judgment of product quality from the buyer, the inspection calibrates overall garments factory quality control. Without passing final inspection, garments cannot be shipped. A final inspection report is the quality certificate from a garment buyer which gives a certificate of a factory about their finished product quality that allows or rejects to ship garments. There are specific quality checking points of a finished garments final audit, here I have given these below. ➔ Workmanship ➔ Appearance ➔ Measurement/Fittings ➔ Materials ➔ Accessories ➔ Finishing/Packing ","234 Workmanship ● Fusing ● Open seam ● Broken stitch ● Miss/Skip Stitch ● Mending ● Seam grinning ● SPI incorrect ● Needle damage/cut/holes ● Puckering/Twisting ● Stripes/Plaid Mismatching ● Stepping or Hi-low ● Misaligned/Insecure Buttons ● Crooked stitching ● Raw edge ● Looseness/Knots ● Buttonhole ● Incorrect tension ● Main Label open/slanted ● Contrast thread visible ● Loop slanted Appearance ● Loose/uncut thread ● Dirt mark ● Oil stain ● Garment damp ● Crushed ● Pressing ● Shining ● Wrinkle Measurement/Fittings ● Out of tolerance any measurement points ","235 Materials ● Body fabric way ● Contrast fabric ● Print/Dyeing Fault ● Color Shading ● Bald Patches ● Holes or Cuts ● Yarn Runs ● Slubs ● Color fly/ Foreign yarn Accessories ● Thread/ Yarn ● Main Label ● Care Label ● Zipper ● Tapping/Capping ● Screenprint/Embroidery ● Buttons/Snaps/Rivets ● Velcro ● Elastic Finishing/Packing ● Assortment ● Carton Marks ● Polybag printing ● Hangtag ● Price ticket ● Barcode ● Carton Barcode ","236 Sewing Defects Solve with Root Causes and Corrective Actions Reducing sewing defects is the key task for garments quality management and it is one of the challenging jobs. This article is all about solving sewing defects/faults. Here I have listed a total of 15 defects of garments, root causes, and corrective action to reduce them. After reading this article hopefully, you will be able to know how it is possible to reduce Sewing Defects to Solve with Root Causes. Sewing Defects Solving Process: In a sewing defects solving process you may commonly find the following process. This one is a continuous process you need to follow to solve your sewing defects problem in the garment industry. ● Find out top defects respective areas ● Find out Root causes by the 6M method ● Taking corrective action ● Assign work of a responsible person ● Keep statistical data ● Follow up improvement Root Causes of Garments Defects Manufacturers have to find out all causes behind defects to work on it. As a quality control person, you need to do practical work in a defect occurring place to find out all the reasons behind every defect. The best method is to follow the 6M method for Cause and Effect Analysis. 6M is finding root causes against 6 criteria. 6M’s are ★ M – Machinery ★ M – Manpower ★ M – Mother-nature ★ M – Method ","237 ★ M – Materials ★ M – Measurement Corrective Action of Sewing Defects: A corrective action is a measure taken to solve or correct a defect.

Before making a cloth you have to cut off individual parts as per the approved pattern, whereas proper measurement must be ensured so that all cutting parts are 100% accurate. Parts of Quality Control Cutting Section Quality control of the cutting section is mainly divided into four parts. Those are: ➔ Marker Inspection ➔ Spreading Control ➔ Cutting Quality control ➔ Piece Goods Inspection In Marker Inspection following things are inspected: ● Marker Length ● Marker width ● Lay quantity ● Style/Lot ● Ratio ● The measure of all individual parts marked in marker Following work in Spreading Quality control: ● Cut numbers ● Ends ● Leaning ","245 ● Tension ● Narrow Goods ● Remnants ● Counts ● Ply Height ● Fabric Fault Cutting Quality Control: ● Number of parts ● Miss cut ● Ragged cutting ● Notches ● Matching plies Cut Piece /Cake Goods Inspection ● Quantity ● End out ● Knot ● Spot ● Hole ● Thick yarn ● Missing yarn ● Shading ● Slab ","246 CHAPTER 3: INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING ","247 What is Industrial Engineering? Industrial Engineering is an engineering profession that is concerned with the optimization of complex processes, systems, or organizations by developing, improving and implementing integrated systems of people, money, knowledge, information and equipment. Industrial engineering is central to manufacturing operations. There are several industrial engineering principles followed in the manufacturing industry to ensure the effective flow of the systems, processes and operations. This includes: ➢ Lean Manufacturing, ➢ Six Sigma, ➢ Information Systems, ➢ Process Capability ➢ and DMAIC. These principles allow the creation of new systems, processes or situations for the useful coordination of labor, materials and machines and also improve the quality and productivity of systems, physical or social. Depending on the sub-specialties involved, industrial engineering may also overlap with, ● operations research, ● systems engineering, ● manufacturing engineering, ● production engineering, ● supply chain engineering, ● management science, ● management engineering, ● financial engineering, ● ergonomics or human factors engineering, ● safety engineering, ● logistics engineering or others, depending on the viewpoint or motives of the user. ","248 History Of Industrial Engineering There is a general consensus among historians that the roots of the industrial engineering profession date back to the Industrial Revolution. (The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in Great Britain, continental Europe, and the United States, in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840.) The technologies that helped mechanize traditional manual operations in the textile industry including the flying shuttle, the spinning jenny, and perhaps most importantly the steam engine generated economies of scale that made mass production in centralized locations attractive for the first time. It has also been suggested that perhaps Leonardo da Vinci was the first Industrial Engineer, because there is evidence that he applied science to the analysis of human work, by examining the rate at which a man could shovel dirt around the year 1500. Others also state that the IE profession grew from Charles Babbage’s study of factory operations and specifically his work on the manufacture of straight pins in 1832 . Specialization of labor Adam Smith's concepts of Division of Labor and the \"Invisible Hand\" of capitalism introduced in his treatise \"The Wealth of Nations\" motivated many of the ","249 technological innovators of the Industrial revolution to establish and implement factory systems. The efforts of James Watt and Matthew Boulton led to the first integrated machine manufacturing facility in the world, including the application of concepts such as cost control systems to reduce waste and increase productivity and the institution of skills training for craftsmen. The division of labor is the separation of the tasks in any economic system or organization so that participants may specialize (specialization). Historically, an increasing division of labor is associated with the growth of total output and trade, the rise of capitalism, and the increasing complexity of industrialized processes. The concept and implementation of division of labor has been observed in ancient Sumerian (Mesopotamian) culture, where assignment of jobs in some cities coincided with an increase in trade and economic interdependence. Pioneers Frederick Taylor (1856 – 1915) is generally credited as being the father of the Industrial Engineering discipline. He earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology and earned several patents from his inventions. His books, Shop Management and The Principles of Scientific Management which were published in the early 1900s, were the beginning of Industrial Engineering. Improvements in work efficiency under his methods was based on improving work methods, developing of work standards, and reduction in time required to carry out the work. With an abiding faith in the scientific method, Taylor's contribution to ","250 \"Time Study\" sought a high level of precision and predictability for manual tasks. The husband-and-wife team of Frank Gilbreth (1868 – 1924) and Lillian Gilbreth (1878 – 1972) was the other cornerstone of the Industrial Engineering movement whose work is housed at Purdue University School of Industrial Engineering. They categorized the elements of human motion into 18 basic elements called therbligs. With the development of assembly lines, the factory of Henry Ford (1913) accounted for a significant leap forward in the field. Ford reduced the assembly time of a car from more than 700 hours to 1.5 hours. In addition, he was a pioneer of the economy of capitalist welfare (\"welfare capitalism\") and the flag of providing financial incentives for employees to increase productivity. ","251 Process flow chart of IE: At present Industrial Engineering (IE) is one of the important departments for each garment or textile factory. Today’s maximum factory is run by industrial engineers, where they have to follow a process flow chart. By which they can easily control the whole garments production processes.

Here, he should vastly discuss with the merchandiser about the in-coming garments product. 02 Garments analysis Confirmed garments product is clearly analyzed here by an industrial engineer. It helps to complete the rest of the processes very easily. 03 Make P.P meeting Here, P.P meetings should be organized if all the required fabrics, trimmings, and accessories are housed and take all the precautions for the up- coming garments production. 04 Production target Production targets should be set here according to factory capacity. It helps to respect the ","253 shipment date. 05 Set machine layout Machine layout is set here according to the total processes needed to complete a garment item. 06 Line setting In this process, the actual line setting should be done to utilize the garment workers properly. If it takes more time in line setting then garments production will be decreased. 07 Line balancing To minimize the number of workstations, cycle time, line balancing is done here. It’s a very important process to achieve the desired production target. 08 Continuous production meeting Production meetings should be done here at regular intervals. If any problem arises during garment production, we should take necessary actions to solve that. 09 Collecting production data Production data should be collected here for preparing the production report. 10 Preparing production report Here, the total garments production report has been prepared to analyze the whole production. 11 Production report analysis The clothing production report is analyzed here from different points of view. ","254 12 Report submitted to the factory manager Finally, the garments production report has to be submitted to the factory manager. Industrial Engineering at BGL Industrial Engineering assigns certain systems such as floor layouts, personnel, organization, the standard of time, wage rates, incentive payment plants to control the quantity and especially the quality of goods and services produced. Industrial Engineering (IE) obeys the following contents: ● Forecasting, ● Routing and Scheduling, ● Line Balancing, ● Break-Even Analysis, ● PERT and CPM, ● Inventory Control, ● Materials Requirement Planning, ● Work-Study, ● Plant Layout, ● Quality Analysis, and Control, ● Process Capability, ● Graphical Method, ● Simplex Method, ● Transportation Model, ● Assignment Model, ● Queuing Model, ● Value Analysis for Cost, ● Wages Plan, ● Mass Production and, ● Others. ","255 Pre-Production Meeting A pre-production meeting is known as a PP meeting in the Garments or Apparel industry. In a pre-production meeting discussion of every important issue related to bulk production is done, so that respected parties can ensure the successful shipment of ordered goods. In a PP meeting what type of precautionary measures need to be taken by the company is being set. A pre-production meeting is basically a meeting before starting bulk production, to set every parameter and core decision of production. This article is all about pre-production meetings in the apparel industry. Working Procedure of Pre Production Meeting: ● Make a plan of bulk Production ● Make layout ● Review PP sample/Size set sample/ 1st Production. ● Discussing all the process parameters of every section. ● Review all checklists of PP meetings. ● Giving special instruction for bulk production. ● Find out all construction and structural defects of PP sample/Size set/1st production Merchandiser confirms that all necessary items are already in-house for finished garments. Some Important Documents to Present in PP Meeting ● Purchase order sheet (PO Sheet) ● Fabric inventory Report ● Trims and Accessories inventory Report ● Shade Grading Report ● Shrinkage Report ● Fabric Inspection Report ● Trims and Accessories Inspection Report ","256 Attendances of Parties in Pre Production Meeting PP meetings can be held in buying houses or factories or in both. These respective people need to be present in Pre-Production Meeting: ● Buying QC ● Merchandiser ● Technical Team ● Head of Warehouse ● Head of cutting ● Head of Sewing ● Head of Finishing ● Production Representative/PM ● Quality Representative ● Industrial Engineer Calculate Hourly Production Target ● calculate hourly production target for an individual operation ● calculate hourly production target for a production line. Hourly production target calculation is a part of an operation bulletin preparation and daily production report. In an OB production target is calculated for each operation. The following formula is used to calculate the hourly target: Hourly production target = (60 / Operation SAM) An hour is equal to 60 minutes. Divide the 60 by the operation SAM. The end result of this calculation tells you the number of pieces that can be produced per hour, which is the hourly production target for the selected operation. Let’s take an example. SAM of an operation is 0.5 minutes. The hourly production target would be =(60/0.50) =120 pieces Note: This target is calculated at 100% efficiency. In case you want to plan hourly production targets at a particular percentage, multiply the above by individual ","257 operator efficiency. Let’s say the skill level of that operator is 80% efficiency, in that case, the production target would be: (60/0.50)*80% =120*80% =96 pieces The information you need for calculating the hourly production target is ● Standard time (SAM) of the operation ● Average efficiency of the line Calculation of Hourly production target of a line: On the other hand for calculating hourly production target for a production line use the following formula Hourly Production Target of a line =((60 * No. of operators working in a line * Line efficiency %) /Garment SAM) If you need to calculate the daily production target of a line, just multiply the hourly line target by shift hours. SAM in Garment Industry As defined in the book Introduction to Work Study, ILO, Standard minute is defined as the following. SAM is the time value arrived at for a task based on the average rate of output which qualified workers will naturally achieve without overexertion provided that they know and adhere to the specified method and provided that they are motivated to apply themselves to their work. Here SAM stands for Standard Allowed Minute. In the garment industry, specifically in production SAM is used for measuring work. ","258 In the factory work-study department (also known as the Industrial Engineering department) measure and calculate SAM for sewing operation using a standard calculation method. Garments Cost of Making (CM): Calculating the cost of making (CM) for any garment items is an important factor in garments merchandising. Every garment merchandiser should know the actual calculating method of it. Otherwise, a factory may fall into a huge loss. Because of its importance in garments merchandising, today I will present an easy method for calculating the cost of making (CM) for any garment item. Calculate the Cost of Making (CM) of Garments: Before calculating the cost of making (CM) for any clothing items, a garment merchandiser should confirm the following matters: ● Factory total expenditure per month (running), it includes factory rent, electricity bill, water bill, commercial cost, transportation, worker & staff wages, etc. ● A total number of machines in the factory. ● A total number of machines is required to complete an item. ● Targeted production per hour from the existing layout (excluding alter and reject). ● Total working day per month. ● Total working hours per day. Now by applying the following formula, a garment merchandiser can easily calculate the actual cost of garment making. Cost of making (CM) per pcs, Now one example is enough to remove all the confusion from the above discussion. Example: Suppose, BGL has received an order of basic T-Shirt items. ","259 Where, ● BGLs total expenditure per month-30,00,000 taka ● Total number of machines in the factory-100 ● Total number of machines required to complete an item-25 ● Targeted production per hour from the existing layout-180 ● Total working day per month-26 ● Total working hours per day-08 Now calculate the costs of making(CM) of the mentioned item? Solution: Cost of making (CM) per pcs: = 20.03 taka per pcs = (20.03 × 12) taka per dozen = 240.38 taka per dozen = 240.38/78 (in dollar) {1dollar-78taka (running)} = $3.08 per dozen So, the costs of making (CM) per dozen basic T-Shirt is $3.08 ","260 Generalized Sewing Data (GSD) GSD (General Sewing Data) is an engineering technology of method analysis and time study designed specially for the clothing industry. GSD derives from MTM (Methods Time Measurement) database which is a predetermined motion time system. Standard time of corresponding motions can be found in the database. GSD analyzes all motions that can occur in the sewing process of sewing personnel according to the operation process of the sewing industry and then forms operation standard time. GSD database GSD divides the operation in sewing industry into processing operation and machinery operation expressed with motion code as shown in table 1. Stage I of processing operation represents the category of basic motions in clothing industry. Basic motions in stage I can be described with therbligs of “G” or “P” in stage II.Standard time of processing operation. Processing operation has 52 basic motions. Let’s take “get and match parts” for example. It includes six basic motions such as “match and get two parts at the same time” or “match and get two parts respectively”. Analysis on therbligs of “match and get two parts at the same time” is conducted, which finds that the motion is composed of 5 therbligs, i.e. “get-get-put-get-get”. It can be expressed with motion code “GGPGG”, as shown in fig.1. In motions above, left and right hands complete the first and second “get” at the ","261 same time. After garment pieces are put together, the left hand sorts one end of the garment piece and the right hand slides down and sorts the other end, thus completing the whole set of motions. The operation time of corresponding therbligs is enquired in the MTM database. It is obtained that standard time is 76TMU (TMU is the smallest unit of time. One second is 33.33TMU). Table 2 can be obtained through analysis on six basic motions in “get and match parts” according to the process above. Similarly, therbligs and corresponding standard time in 52 basic motions can be found. Standard time database of processing operations can be established. Standard time of machinery operation. Different factors such as machine used, sewing stitch and sewing length will produce influence on standard time of machinery operation. The code of standard ","262 time of machinery operation is composed of four parts, as shown in table 3. Primary sewing length can be adjusted correspondingly according to actual sewing length. If the sewing length is 40cm, the code is 40. Sewing requirements have four codes respectively representing different stitches. Different addition coefficients are given respectively according to different degrees of difficulty, as shown in table 4. Discontinuation accuracy will influence sewing speed. The higher the requirement for discontinuation accuracy is, the more the time spent will be, as shown in table 5. Calculation steps of sewing time are shown as below: (1) Minimum sewing time ST refers to number of threads; CM refers to sewing length; RPM refers to maximum sewing speed of sewing machine, i.e. rotation number of wheel per minute when feet press the pedal. Rotation number per minute and number of threads per ","263 minute are the same because the needle moves up or down for each circle of rotation of the motor, i.e. sewing completes one stitch. (2) Calculation of feed speed Feed speed = RPM/（ST/CM）=CM/min The higher the feed speed is, the more the time of distributing control by the sewing worker will be. Therefore, sewing time will also increase correspondingly. If feed speed is more than 445CM/min, high-speed coefficient HSF should be calculated; if it is less than the minimum value, HSF=fixed value 1. (3) Calculation of high-speed coefficient HSF=（4.5-MST）2/100+1 (4) Calculation of sewing time T=（MST×HSF×GT×CM）+17+P Where, T refers to total processing time, GT refers to sewing type (N, L, M, H) of different degrees of difficulty and P refers to discontinuation accuracy (A, B, C).17 is fixed value, i.e. time spent for starting and stopping the machine. The sequence of all operations of each employee per day can be described accurately through motion codes above, thus helping enterprises to establish a standard operating method. Meanwhile, accurate operation time can be provided. Steps for determining standard time of sewing Standard time of garment sewing is composed of GSD pure processing time and allowance time. Its factors of influence include processing flow, technology, equipment, worker, environment and standard motion. GSD pure processing time. Step 1: analyze garment style, specify technological requirements and determine the specification of raw and auxiliary materials, standard and required equipment. ","264 Step 2: analyze garment process, divide minimum operating unit and make process flow chart. Step 3: conduct motion analysis on the minimum operating unit. Conduct motion analysis on a minimum operating unit with observation method or image analysis method, pick out appropriate motion code from GSD database, find out the corresponding working time and obtain GSD pure processing time. Let’s take “stitch watch pocket mouth and stitch the sole to the upper of the watch pocket” of jeans for example. Through therblig analysis, it can be decomposed into the following: (1) Hold watch pocket with single hand (once); (2) Adjust and seize stitching position (twice); (3)Get (once);  (4) Move cut-parts below presser foot (once); (5) Sew a 8cm straight open line and discontinue accurately (once); (6) Break stitches (once); (7) Put watch pocket with single hand (once); (8) Stick watch pocket (once); (9) Get watch pocket and pocket facing with both hands at the same time (watch pocket on the left hand) (once); (10) Fold end stitching with a finger (once); (11) Align at powder position (once); (12) Press and hold (once); (13) Move garment piece below presser foot (once); (14) Back stitching with computer (once); (15) Sew a 9cm multi-layer straight open line and discontinue accurately (once); (16) Turn the direction of garment piece (once); (17) Set down presser foot (once); (18) Fold end stitching with a finger (once); (19) Sew a 6cm multi-layer straight open line and discontinue accurately (once); (20) Turn the direction of garment piece (once); (21) Set down presser foot (once); (22) Align at powder position (once); (23) Sew a 9cm multi-layer straight open line and discontinue accurately (once); (24) Back stitching with computer (once); (25) Put back watch pocket with single hand (once) The time of 25 therbligs is added together. GSD pure processing time of “stitch watch pocket mouth and stitch the sole to the upper of watch pocket” is 22.7s.In GSD data measurement, two principles should be stuck to: first, principle of motion economy, e.g. simultaneous operation of left and right hands; second, concept of continuous improvement. However, pure processing time calculated with such a method is not necessarily appropriate for all enterprises. In the process of actual application, processing time will be adjusted slightly under external influencing factors. ● (1) Degree of worker training. Motions of workers during operation should be ","265 standardized. Workers without motion standardization will have some unconscious motions and increase processing time. ● (2) Preparation of machinery equipment. On the one hand, the technical level of the machine will influence processing time. On the other hand, it is necessary to readjust the machine before starting work so as to avoid the increase of processing time caused by machine faults. ● (3) Setting position of garment piece. The time for workers getting a garment piece and putting it after completion will be influenced by the distance and level of placement of the garment piece. Allowance time Allowance time refers to additional time considering the influence of external factors on work such as machine downtime for adjustment, physiological needs of people and variety change when employees work all day. Generally, allowance time is directly added to GSD processing time in percentage form, which then becomes standard operating time. Allowance time generally has five types: personal allowance, fatigue allowance, procedural allowance, special allowance and policy allowance. (1) Personal allowance refers to the time required for maintaining employees’ comfort in work and psychological need, such as the time for drinking water and going to the bathroom. (2) Fatigue allowance refers to the allowance due to the reduction of production efficiency caused by physical or psychological fatigue because of continuous work. Fatigue can be reduced but cannot be avoided completely through the improvement of operational methods, the introduction of advanced equipment or the creation of a good working environment. (3) Procedural allowance refers to the allowance time required for inevitable delay in operation, such as the time of waiting in the case of machine fault or the time wasted for waiting for the previous process in the production line. Procedural allowance time can be reduced through comprehensive equipment management or production line balance management. (4) Special allowance refers to allowance permitted specially caused by process difficulty or fabric etc. ","266 (5) Policy allowance belongs to allowance time given by management policy, i.e. extra allowance given to retain some special people or during the period of reform and transition of a company, e.g. compensatory allowance for retaining some old experienced and skillful employees in many domestic old-brand clothing enterprises. However, such allowance is often canceled with the change of environment. Function of GSD standard time Garment sewing production belongs to semi-hand semi-mechanized work. The establishment of standard time is good for standardizing enterprise management work, reducing production cost and improving production efficiency. ● Determine standard operation and establish a more economical operating method. The study on GSD standard time starts from interference in the operation of employees and helps administrators discover redundant and wasted motion in operation. Meanwhile, in the study of tiny motions, it is feasible to establish more economical operating methods and improve operating standards with methods such as tool improvement for difficult operations in time. ● Good for the balance of the production line. Reasonable allocation of resources such as machinery equipment and personnel according to standard time of each process can avoid waste caused by uneven resources and meanwhile make production lines achieve the highest efficiency. ● As the basis of the production plan. The basis of the production plan is production capacity. Accurate standard time of production calculated can allow to obtain the information about daily, weekly and monthly production capacity of each production line more accurately and establish production plan more reasonably and scientifically under control. ● Accurate and rapid budgeting of processing cost. The essence of piece wage is hourly wage. As long as the processing cost of unit time is known, processing charges of clothing can be budgeted accurately and rapidly so as to provide a theoretical basis for product offer and sales. ","267 ● Provide basis for performance assessment of employees. The comparison of target yield and actual yield is used as the standard for assessing the performance of employees. Application and promotion of GSD standard time in clothing enterprises .The promotion of GSD standard time in clothing enterprises can be divided into four stages, as shown in fig.2 Stage I: theoretical training. Select employees with foundation and learning ability from enterprise for the training of GSD basic knowledge. Stage II: skill training. Training contents include the analysis on garment style, garment production process, standard for time selection for employee test and measurement of GSD time requirements etc. Stage III: establish database. GSD database appropriate for the enterprise should be established according to product features and management level of each enterprise. Stage IV: database promotion and application. New styles received by enterprises should be analyzed and relevant data should be obtained from the database. Data ","268 unavailable in the database can be supplemented, thus improving the enterprise database constantly. Technologies of GSD in establishing time standards and improving operating methods are not only limited to garment sewing operations. They can also be used in links such as cutting, pressing, inspection and packaging. Further study in the future is required. ","269 Layout Planning The key aim of every layout is to maximize utilization of available space in order to optimize the material flow, maintaining visibility or ease of supervision. The other benefits of a good layout may be improving on other productivity factors such as manpower, machine and lesser defects. Different production setups have different arrangements of resources depending on a number of factors such as product, process, and space availability, and of course the mindset of the management. Figure 1: Initial layout of the factory We observe a number of variations in the machine layouts having its own pros and cons. And we always starve for better layouts aiming for maximizing unidirectional material movement, optimum handling and storage of cut parts, half- finished parts and complete garment for easy retrieval. Manoj Tiwari, Associate Professor, NIFT Jodhpur and Dr. Prabir Jana, NIFT Delhi discuss various aspects of an effective layout with actual shop floor cases, observing ","270 significant and visible improvements. Layout plays a critical role in making the IE practices effective and significantly visible. An effective machine arrangement may help in smoothening various kinds of flows (man, material etc.). This also helps in improving on quality issues, throughput time and very importantly making the problems visible. Many times, we observe machine arrangements in a very haphazard and unorganized manner where it’s very difficult to even understand the flow. This kind of situation makes operators confused and the supervisor couldn’t channelize his attention to his many activities. The layout planning should be as simple as possible and able to link the different departments and processes seamlessly. The activities should be arranged in a logical sequence making the control effective and result in minimum man, material and equipment movement. Such layout also has a number of other benefits such as effective control of WIP, efficient space utilization, minimum time consumed in transportation, improved cleanliness, effective man and machine utilization and ","271 last but not the least making the problems visible. [For further understanding refer to Apparel Plant Layout: Basics in SW May 2009 and Improve Factory Layout to Boost Productivity in SW September 2010]. There are two levels of layout planning done by industrial engineers: in macro level it is the factory layout and in micro level it is the layout of sewing machines in a sewing line. The macro level factory layout is done once during factory setup or during expansion, major re-planning and not on a daily basis. The micro level machine layout is done during every new style planning. The sewing machine layout planning depends on long term factors like style changeover system and storage and movement of semi-finished material within the sewing line. These systems or policies generally remain unchanged for a factory, and an industrial engineer generally plans the machine location and their sequence based on the operation breakdown flowchart to minimize the flow path of semi-finished parts. Often the material handling system and equipment is also changed based on style change which will be discussed in the next article. The sewing machine position within a layout can be facing unidirectional, reverse directional, straight or angular and each layout has its own advantages and disadvantages (read SW, May 2009). An IE has to choose the most appropriate layout for his overall factory settings. We will discuss the factory layout (macro level) planning as well as machine layout (micro level) planning with case examples each. Example Case: Case of a factory Like the sewing lines sequential arrangement of machines is critical, such arrangement is equally important while deciding the factory layout. Many times, we observe that various sections are located without any logical thinking. It is very important to keep all the related departments/processes near to each other. This results not only in minimized material and manpower movement but improved control and ease of supervision. Just by using a little common sense and understanding the process flow, significant visible improvements can be done. This ","272 is also very important that the changes should make the process smooth, that too without much disturbance; besides other important things to consider that any such changes should be done with minimum possible investment to avoid financial burden on the factory management. Figure 3: Initial layout of packing section Let’s understand this with a case of a factory whose layout was modified. The old layout of the factory is shown in Figure 1. Few points can be easily observed from this layout as below 1. Packing activity is happening at different places which may make the control difficult and may as well hamper the space utilization. 2. A small fabric store is located near Sewing Section 2, which is far from the main fabric store. This is resulting in an increased fabric movement while fabric is carried for cutting. 3. Embroidery section is located near to Sewing Section 2; due to this cut panels which are going to be embroidered have to travel comparatively more distance from the cutting section before coming back for bundling. 4. A good space is occupied by the old and unused machines. ","273 While observing the old layout critically, we find that there are few spaces which are not utilized properly; such spaces are areas available near to the clinic and space occupied by old and unused machines. A logical re-arrangement may result in seamless linking of processes and an improved space utilization as shown in the modified layout (refer Figure 2). Few modifications can be observed in the modified layout: ➢ Embroidery section, CAD and sampling room have been moved near to the cutting section. This may bring improved control and less distance traveled in material movement. ➢ Old and unused machines have been relocated to the area near the clinic with a provision of gate opening towards Sewing Section 1. This has resulted in free space between Sewing Section 1 and Sewing Section 2. ➢ Small fabric store has been relocated from Sewing Section 2 (in the area earlier occupied by CAD and sampling room), near to the fabric store and cutting section. This will result in an easy fabric transaction while cutting as well as effective supervision. ➢ Packing which was happening at different places has been arranged to be at one place, between Sewing Section 1 and Sewing Section 2 with only 1 entry and exit points. ➢ The modifications done (as mentioned in point No. 1 to 4) have resulted into an increased space availability in the Sewing Section 2 which can accommodate at least 90 additional sewing machines and makes Sewing Section 1 and Sewing Section 2 equal in terms of number of sewing machines accommodated. The rearrangement of layout (Case Study 1) resulted in improved space utilization, better (minimized) flow of material, seamless linking of fabric store, CAD & Sampling and Cutting Department. Another visible improvement is an exclusive packing section with no disturbance or interference of other sections. The same has been done with no or minimum investment and disturbance to the regular activities. ","274 Some Essential Formulas and Examples for Industrial Engineer: 1. Standard Pitch Time (S.P.T) = Basic Pitch Time (B.P.T) + Allowances (%) 7. GSD = (Man power * Work hour) / Target 8. SMV = Basic time + (Basic time * Allowance) 9. Basic time = Observed time * Rating 10. Observed time = Total Cycle time / No of cycle 11. Rating = (Observed Rating * Standard rating) / Standard rating 12.

Line GSD/day = (Manpower * work hour) / target = (50 * 10 * 60)/900 = 33 ","278 CHAPTER 4: PRODUCTION PLANNING, CONTROL & CO- ORDINATION ","279 Production planning and control (PPC) plays an important role in the garments manufacturing business. It’s very good news that maximum factories are now creating the PPC department. Production planning and control (PPC) has to build- up a strong relationship with the other departments to achieve maximum output from the export order. As its importance in the ready-made garments sector today I will present here the important relationship of production planning and control (PPC) with other departments. Production Planning and Control: PPC means production planning and control. The production planning and control (PPC) department is related not only to planning garments productions but also to control the production. The main functions of production planning and control (PPC) are follow-up and execution of garment export order, job scheduling, material resource planning, facility location, loading production, process selection and planning, capacity planning, line planning, estimating quantity and costs of production. Relation of Production Planning and Control (PPC) with other departments: Productions planning and control (PPC) department has to connect with various departments, those are mentioned in the below: ● Top management, ● Yarn department, ● Knitting department, ● Dyeing and washing department, ● Garments merchandising department, ● Commercial department, ","280 ● Cutting department, ● Stitching department, ● Finishing and packaging department. Functions of productions planning and control (PPC) with all the above departments have discussed in the following: 1. Top management: Top management consists of the Managing Director (M.D) and General Manager (GM). The Production planning and control (PPC) department plays an important role with the top management by providing all the information to them. 2. Store department: The function of the yarn department is to in-house necessary fabric & trims depending on the swatch card. Here, the production planning and control (PPC) department contacts the yarn department to ensure all the requirements about the yarn according to the buyer’s instruction. 3. Knitting department (not applicable for BGL): The knitting department ensures all the knitting procedures according to the fabric consumption chart. PPC department follow-ups the knitting department to produce the required amount of fabrics in its definite time with the right quality and quantity. 4. Dyeing and washing department: It’s an important department for the PPC team which dyed and washed all the knitted fabrics according to the buyer's instructions. Here, the PPC team ensures the perfect dyeing shade. 5. Garments merchandising department: Here, the PPC team ensures the clothing merchandising department about the overall situation of the garment export order. 6. Commercial department: The commercial department is related to all kinds of financial support for the export order. It also deals with all the banking functions such as L/C opening, preparing shipping documents, etc. Here, the PPC team ensures all the financial matters by ","281 discussing them with top management. 7. Cutting department: Here, the production planning and control (PPC) department contacts the cutting department to ensure all the cutting procedures in its definite item. 8. Stitching/Technical/Production/IE department: Production planning and control (PPC) department contacts the stitching department to ensure the total garment production according to shipping date. 9. Finishing and packaging department: Here, the production planning and control (PPC) department ensures the perfect finishing and packaging of goods so that it can’t hamper during inspection and shipping. Value Stream Mapping of an RMG: ","282 CHAPTER 5: SIX SIGMA OVERVIEW ","283 What is six Sigma? Six Sigma (6σ) is a set of techniques and tools for process improvement. It was introduced by American engineer Bill Smith while working at Motorola in 1986. A six sigma process is one in which 99.99966% of all opportunities to produce some feature of a part are statistically expected to be free of defects. Six Sigma strategies seek to improve manufacturing quality by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. This is done by using empirical and statistical quality management methods and by hiring people who serve as Six Sigma experts. Each Six Sigma project follows a defined methodology and has specific value targets, such as reducing pollution or increasing customer satisfaction. The term Six Sigma originates from the statistical modeling of manufacturing processes. The maturity of a manufacturing process can be described by a sigma rating indicating its yield or the percentage of defect-free products it creates— specifically, within how many standard deviations of a normal distribution the fraction of defect-free outcomes corresponds History Motorola pioneered Six Sigma, setting a \"six sigma\" goal for its manufacturing business. It registered Six Sigma as a service mark on June 11, 1991, U.S. Service Mark 1,647,704; on December 28, 1993, it registered Six Sigma as a trademark. In 2005 Motorola attributed over $17 billion in savings to Six Sigma. ","284 Honeywell and General Electric were also early adopters of Six Sigma. As GE's CEO, in 1995 Jack Welch made it central to his business strategy, and in 1998 it announced $350 million in cost savings thanks to Six Sigma, which was an important factor in the spread of Six Sigma (this figure later grew to more than $1 billion). By the late 1990s, about two-thirds of the Fortune 500 organizations had begun Six Sigma initiatives with the aim of reducing costs and improving quality. In recent years, some practitioners have combined Six Sigma ideas with lean manufacturing to create a methodology named Lean Six Sigma.The Lean Six Sigma methodology views lean manufacturing, which addresses process flow and waste issues, and Six Sigma, with its focus on variation and design, as complementary disciplines aimed at promoting \"business and operational excellence\". In 2011, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) published the first standard \"ISO 13053:2011\" defining a Six Sigma process. Other standards have been created mostly by universities or companies with Six Sigma first-party certification programs. Toyota Production System The Toyota Production System (TPS) is an integrated socio-technical system, developed by Toyota, that comprises its management philosophy and practices. The TPS is a management system that organizes manufacturing and logistics for the automobile manufacturer, including interaction with suppliers and customers. The system is a major precursor of the more generic \"lean manufacturing\". Taiichi Ohno and Eiji Toyoda, Japanese industrial engineers, developed the system between 1948 and 1975. Originally called \"just-in-time production\", it builds on the approach created by the founder of Toyota, Sakichi Toyoda, his son Kiichiro Toyoda, and the engineer Taiichi Ohno. The principles underlying the TPS are embodied in The Toyota Way. Goals The main objectives of the TPS are to design out overburden (muri) and inconsistency (mura), and to eliminate waste (Muda). The most significant effects on process value delivery are achieved by designing a process capable of delivering the required results smoothly; by designing out \"mura\" (inconsistency). It is also crucial to ensure that the process is as flexible as necessary without stress or ","285 \"muri\" (overburden) since this generates \"muda\" (waste). Finally, the tactical improvements of waste reduction or the elimination of Muda are very valuable. There are eight kinds of Muda that are addressed in the TPS: The elimination of waste has come to dominate the thinking of many when they look at the effects of the TPS because it is the most familiar of the three to implement. In the TPS many initiatives are triggered by the reduction of inconsistency and over- run, both of which drive out waste without a specific focus on its reduction.

","300 Six Sigma: Organization-wide Planning and Deployment “Vision and Mission Statements is a Roadmap of Where You Want to Go and How to Get There” From the perspective of an organization, the problem may be that you are not focusing on what you want to achieve and how you will achieve it. Below are a series of steps or statements of how to give your organization direction. The first is a statement of vision. It provides a destination for the organization. Next is a statement of mission. This is a guiding light of how to get to the destination. These are critical statements for the organization and the individuals who run the organization. ● Vision – Big picture of what you want to achieve. ● Mission – General statement of how you will achieve the vision. A companion statement often created with the vision and mission is a statement of core values. ● Core Values – How you will behave during the process. Once you have identified what your organization wants to achieve (vision) and generally how the vision will be achieved (mission), the next step is to ","301 Develop a series of statements specifying how the mission will be utilized to achieve the vision: ● Strategies – Strategies are one or more ways to use the mission statement in order to achieve the vision statement. Although an organization will have just one vision statement and one mission statement, it may have several strategies. ● Goals – These are general statements of what needs to be accomplished to implement a strategy. ● Objectives – Objectives provide specific milestones with a specific timeline for achieving a goal. ● Action Plans – These are specific implementation plans of how you will achieve an objective. A more in-depth discussion of these statements is presented below. Statements for an example business are provided for clarification. Vision Statement – A mental picture of what you want to accomplish or achieve. For example, your vision may be a successful winery business or an economically active community. ","302 Vision & Philosophy of Bitopi Group: “The vision is derived from its name''Bitopi ``. Bitopi is a Bengali word, which means a large tree. Our vision is to nurture and grow every business that we are engaged in, in an organic sustainable manner, and to give back to society by not only creating better opportunities for people who are engaged with us but to improve the standard of operations and create centers of excellence.” Mission Statement – A general statement of how the vision will be achieved. The mission statement is an action statement that usually begins with the word \"to\". Mission of the Bitopi Group: “Bitopi believes in bringing world class standards to its work environment, in every business that is engaged in and is dedicated to put Bangladesh on the world map as a destination of excellence and quality.” Core Values– Core values define the organization in terms of the principles and values the leaders will follow in carrying out the activities of the organization. Core Values of Baridhi Garments Limited: ● Honesty ● Skills ● Satisfaction Statements of vision and mission are important so that everyone involved in the organization, including outside stakeholders, understand what the ","303 organization will accomplish and how it will be accomplished. In essence this means “keeping everyone on the same page” so they are all \"pulling in the same direction\". There is a close relationship between the vision and mission. As the vision statement is a static mental picture of what you want to achieve, the mission statement is a dynamic process of how the vision will be accomplished. To create successful statements, you should keep the following concepts in mind. Simple – The vision and mission guide the everyday activities of every person involved in the business. Statements of vision and mission should be simple, concise and easy to remember. Use just enough words to capture the essence. The statements need to capture the very essence of what your organization or business will achieve and how it will be achieved. So statements of vision and mission should be a single thought that can easily be carried in the mind. This makes it easy for everyone in the organization to focus on them. To test the effectiveness of your statements, ask the leaders, managers and employees to tell you the vision and mission of their organization. If they cannot instantaneously tell you both the vision and mission, the statements are of little use. But that doesn’t mean it will be easy to create the statements. It may require several drafts. Most statements are too long. People tend to add additional information and qualifications to the statements. Usually the additional information just confuses the reader and clouds the essence of the statement. Each successive draft of the vision and mission should be to simplify and clarify by using as few words as possible. Fluid Process – The statements are not \"cast in stone\". They can be updated and modified if the organization changes its focus. It is often good to write the statements, use them for a period of time, and then revisit them a few months or a year later if needed. ","304 It may be easier to sharpen the focus of the statement at that time. Remember, the reason you are writing the statements is to clarify what you are doing. Unique and Complex Organizations – It is usually more important to write statements for non-traditional organizations where the purpose of the organization is unique. The same is true for complex organizations where it may be difficult to sift down to the essence of the existence of the organization. Strategies, Goals, Objectives and Action Plans Once you have created statements of vision and mission, and possibly core values, you can then develop the strategies, goals, objectives and action plans needed to activate your mission and achieve your vision. Strategies – A strategy is a statement of how you are going to achieve something. More specifically, a strategy is a unique approach of how you will use your mission to achieve your vision. Strategies are critical to the success of an organization because this is where you begin outlining a plan for doing something. The more unique the organization, the more creative and innovative you need to be in crafting your strategies. Goals – A goal is a general statement of what you want to achieve. More specifically, a goal is a milestone(s) in the process of implementing a strategy. Examples of business goals are: ● Increase profit margin ● Increase efficiency ● Capture a bigger market share ● Provide better customer service ● Improve employee training ","305 ● Reduce carbon emissions Be sure the goals are focused on the important aspects of implementing the strategy. Be careful not to set too many goals or you may run the risk of losing focus. Also, design your goals so that they don’t contradict and interfere with each other. A goal should meet the following criteria: Understandable: Is it stated simply and easy to understand? Suitable: Does it assist in implementing a strategy of how the mission will achieve the vision? Acceptable: Does it fit with the values of the organization and its members/employees? Flexible: Can it be adapted and changed as needed? Objectives – An objective turns a goal’s general statement of what is to be accomplished into a specific, quantifiable, time-sensitive statement of what is going to be achieved and when it will be achieved. Examples of business objectives are: ● Earn at least a 20 percent after-tax rate of return on our investment during the next fiscal year ● Increase market share by 10 percent over the next three years. ● Lower operating costs by 15 percent over the next two years through improvement in the efficiency of the manufacturing process. ● Reduce the call-back time of customer inquiries and questions to no more than four hours. Objectives should meet the following criteria: Measurable: What specifically will be achieved and when will it be achieved? Suitable: Does it fit as a measurement for achieving the goal? Feasible: Is it possible to achieve? ","306 Commitment: Are people committed to achieving the objective? Ownership: Are the people responsible for achieving the objective included in the objective-setting process? Action Plans – Action plans are statements of specific actions or activities that will be used to achieve a goal within the constraints of the objective. Examples of action plans within the context of goals and objectives are: Action plans may be simple statements or full blown and detailed business plans where goals and objectives are also included. Action plans may also be used to implement an entire strategy (called strategic planning). Putting it All Together To help you understand the relationship between each of these statements, examples of strategies, goals, objectives and action plans are shown for a business organization designed to improve the rural economy through developing rural businesses. Remember, the vision is what you want to accomplish. Mission is a general statement of how you will achieve your vision. Strategies are a series of ways of using the mission to achieve the vision. Goals are statements of what needs to be accomplished to implement the strategy. Objectives are specific actions and timelines for achieving the goal. Action plans are specific actions that need to be taken for reaching the milestones within the timeline of the objectives. Lean Six Sigma Maturity Model As organizations adopt and deploy Six Sigma, they go through several stages of maturity. Until now, however, there has been no formal description of this evolution. The Six Sigma Maturity Model™, introduced here, provides an outline of five levels of Six Sigma development. The intent of the model is to help Six Sigma practitioners, deployment leaders and executives: ","307 Benchmark where their companies stand in relation to broader patterns experienced by other organizations. ● Assess the areas of strength and performance gaps in their deployments. ● Pinpoint specific steps they might take to close gaps and graduate to the next stage of their Six Sigma journey. ● Communicate progress to their Six Sigma teams and to the broader community within their companies to garner support for their continuous improvement efforts. ● This model has been built out of the experience of working with dozens of leading Six Sigma companies, as well as input from a Six Sigma executive advisory board consisting of prominent consulting firms, authors and luminaries in the field. The Six Sigma Maturity Model outlines each of the five levels along various axes and describes the evolution of the organization along these axes as it progresses through the levels. Time frames that organizations typically spend at each level also are provided. Simple exit criteria define the transition from one level to the next. The model is designed as a general guideline, not a prescriptive roadmap for Six Sigma implementation. The five levels are: 1. Launch – This is the starting point – wherein an initial few visionaries in the organization launch Six Sigma, training is initiated and projects are begun. 2. Early Success – The initial projects are yielding results and early successes are being achieve 3. Scale and Replication – The early success has led to other parts of the organization buying into Six Sigma and a broader launch of projects is under way. 4. Institutionalization – Throughout many parts of the company, projects are yielding broad-based financial impact. 5. Culture Transformation – Six Sigma is part of the organizational DNA, financial impact is sustained and the Six Sigma culture is pervasive – even beyond the Six Sigma practitioners and beyond the company boundaries. ","308 Level 1: Launch Driven by a burning platform in the business, the arrival of a new CEO with a prior Six Sigma background, a competitive benchmarking exercise or a bottom-up effort in a division of an organization, Six Sigma is launched within an enterprise. The launch can be top-down or bottom-up, but launches are generally quicker and more successful when they are top-down. The launch usually occurs with the help of an external consulting and training firm. Consultants typically preside over initial executive and Champion sessions designed to establish the potential impacts of Six Sigma on business operations, revenues, costs and the company culture. There is buy-in to start the initial training sessions to get a core group of Black Belts and Master Black Belts who will lead the initial projects. Organizations generally appoint a vice president or director of Six Sigma who reports to an executive sponsor and whose charter is to ensure a successful deployment of Six Sigma. In bottom-up launches, there may not be as much senior executive involvement; support may only exist at a divisional level. ","309 Table: The Axes Of Launch Axes Characteristics Leadership Support Initial visionaries needed to provide impetus for adoption – top-down or bottom-up Training Executive buy-in via external trainers; Champion training; initial Black Belts identified and trained People A few driven believers, rest of the organization mostly skeptical Project Selection Usually a burning platform provides focus; but need to avoid “boiling the ocean;” need to manage excessive expectations Financial Impact None yet, no projects completed Reporting None yet, no projects completed Key Challenges: To ensure that the initial team executing the Six Sigma effort has the necessary support in the organization, and to ensure proper project selection in order to drive successes at the next level. Duration and Next Level: This level typically lasts between three and nine months. An organization moves to the next level when initial training is completed and the first set of projects is under way, although not yet completed. Level 2: Early Success At this level, the initial projects are well underway – many have been completed. Improvements have already demonstrated significant financial and other impacts. The support that was given to the initial team is being validated by the early results. This is a critical “show me” stage, where it is important for the early successes to be made visible so the rest of the organization can see the real impact from Six Sigma. This is where the ambiguity and uncertainty about the potential business impact of Six Sigma are replaced by proven, relevant examples of business problems faced by the company and addressed by the successful application of Six Sigma. ","310 Table: The Axes of Early Success Axes Characteristics Leadership Support The initial projects that are completed validate the vision of the leadership Training A few waves are completed, usually still external People Initial results are helpful; but most of the organization still waiting to see if this will affect them Project Selection Low-hanging fruit (easy to identify projects that will yield significant results) are plentiful Financial Impact Initial results are having some impact; usually focused on cost reduction Reporting No consistency yet, no roll-ups because number of projects is still small Software Focus is on statistical tools for the Belts Key Challenges: To ensure that projects are completed in a reasonable time and that they have meaningful financial impact on the business. Duration and Next Level: Typical companies stay at this level for between six and 18 months. A company moves to the next level of Six Sigma maturity when the initial successes have led to the other organizations in the company beginning to adopt Six Sigma. Level 3: Scale/Replication At this level, the company has experienced solid success from the initial deployment, and other parts of the company are buying into Six Sigma. This is the stage at which the Six Sigma effort really scales across the company and gathers momentum. Many waves of training are in progress across many parts of the company. Projects are being pursued in multiple organizations (divisions, plants, units, etc.). ","311 Table: The Axes Of Scale/Replication Axes Characteristics Leadership Support Decision to drive Six Sigma throughout the company; leadership across the company buys in Training Many waves across the company; often external trainers; content is customized to the company People Six Sigma now seen as a career development path; change agents throughout the organization see a platform that works Project Selection Usually replication of the patterns of success already done (similar projects for similar problems in plants/distribution centers, etc.) Financial Impact Consistent measures of impact are in place Reporting Enough projects completed so that average impact per project, per Belt, etc. can be predicted; aggregate impact across the organization is significant Software Software goes beyond statistical tools to project tracking; consistent application of methodology and financial impact reporting is ensured Strategy Maturity Creation of strategy maps to ensure that the mass of projects under way are aligned with corporate and organizational priorities Key Challenges: To ensure that the methodology is consistently applied in other parts of the company, and to ensure that financial impact and results are replicated. It is important to have a strong deployment leader for the company who ensures consistency of methodology and results. Duration and Next Level: The Scale/Replication level typically lasts for between one and three years. A company goes to the next level when significant financial results have come in throughout the various organizations in the company and significant financial impact is being reported company-wide. ","312 Level 4: Institutionalization At this level, it is not just replication of the success of another organization, but replication of the success within each organization in the company. There is enough financial impact from projects in each organization that meaningful comparisons can be made between organizations on average project impact, average cycle time, total impact, etc. The Six Sigma processes have become institutionalized throughout the company. Table: The Axes of Institutionalization Axes Characteristics Leadership Support Top leadership across the business units, geographies and divisions are all expected to be Six Sigma supporters Training Very large scale; usually internalized, use of in-house Master Black Belts as trainers; e-learning is used for scale People Initial Black Belt waves have been repatriated, with enhanced career prospects and positions in the organization Project Selection Formal idea-generation/evaluation process in place to ensure continued flow of meaningful projects; no more low-hanging fruit Financial Impact Strict controls in place to ensure validation of results; measures evolve to include revenue impact Reporting Comparison of results for each organizational unit; aggregate corporate-wide results are reported Software Project tracking typically evolves to include knowledge management and portfolio management Strategy Maturity Strategy maps at corporate and organizational level; going beyond alignment, to actually launch projects to impact the strategic goals Beyond DMAIC DMAIC is mastered; but DFSS, Lean, Kaizen, etc. also are integral parts of the organization Key Challenges: To set up consistent processes for Six Sigma execution. For example, consistency should be achieved in areas such as project selection and ","313 scoring, approvals, financial impact measurement and validation, project execution roadmaps, reports, Belt training, etc. This should be pursued while allowing for controlled variation in different parts of the company, ranging, for example, from manufacturing to transaction-heavy organizations. Duration and Next Level: The institutionalization level can last from between two and four years, or more. A company progressed to the next level after multiple years of company-wide adoption of Six Sigma leading to Six Sigma being embedded throughout all parts of the company. Level 5: Culture Transformation At this level, the company has had sustained success with Six Sigma for a long period. Six Sigma is embedded in the company DNA. “Six Sigma is the way we do business” is truly practiced. The methodologies of Six Sigma are applied not just to Six Sigma projects and by people trained in Six Sigma, but throughout all execution processes. Six Sigma also has been applied to the extended enterprise – customers, vendors, distribution chain and supply chain – for mutual benefit. The culture is data- driven, process- and metrics-oriented and focused on financial impact. Table: The Axes Of Culture transfer Axes Characteristics Leadership Support Top leadership across the business units, geographies and divisions are all expected to be Six Sigma supporters Training Very large scale; usually internalized, use of in-house Master Black Belts as trainers; e-learning is used for scale People Initial Black Belt waves have been repatriated, have risen in career stature and positions in the organization Project Selection Formal idea-generation/evaluation process in place to ensure continued flow of meaningful projects Financial Impact Strict controls in place to ensure validation of results; measures include revenue impact Reporting Comparison of results for each organizational unit routinely done; aggregate corporate-wide results are reported ","314 Software Integrated portfolio and strategy management across the enterprise; replacement of legacy applications by vendor applications Strategy Maturity Full closed-loop of strategy, to projects, to roll-up of project results, to organization’s strategic goals Beyond DMAIC Six Sigma is being applied in spirit to all project portfolios – new products, IT projects Culture Change Entire organization operates at a higher performance level; Six Sigma embedded in culture; extends to customers, vendors, supply chain, distribution chain Key Challenges: To continue to keep Six Sigma fresh and to innovate in the new areas where it can be applied as the company inevitably goes through natural business cycles of growth, threat, acquisitions, etc. Duration: There is no end-point or duration at this level. The Value of the Maturity Model Having some standard by which to measure, an organization can assess its own level in the maturity model. This may be done internally, by benchmarking with other companies, or with the help of a consulting firm. A gap analysis can then help identify what critical axes need to progress within the business. After communicating the findings to others in the company and getting buy-in to fix the gaps, the organization can lay out a roadmap of how to advance to the next level and work toward getting there. ","315 Six Sigma: Organizational Process Management & Measures Stakeholder Analysis: The Stakeholder Analysis is a chart which gauges the positioning of stakeholders relative to change and commitment to the goals of the team. Objective: Projects involve change and this often stirs emotions and encounters resistance. The higher the impact of the projected change the more important this tool becomes. The output of the Stakeholder Analysis is a representation of where the impacted people both inside and outside the system stand relative to change. How to weight their input at various stages. ● When and how to keep them informed. ● When do We Use Stakeholder Analysis? We use stakeholder analysis before we start planning a project. Why? Because we need to know who we need to be talking to and what we’ll need from them. Until we have that, we can’t create an effective plan. And we also need to plan our output. This affects what we’ll put into updates and when. It is important that the team starts its journey with team members and stakeholders that minimize resistance to change. This tool is commonly used in DFSS or DMAIC projects throughout the duration especially if it is a longer term project. Its objective is to detect an \"out of control\" position by a key team member and get it corrected by continually monitoring this behavioral pattern. Those that are not at the level of commitment or willingness to accept change need to be converted. This tool is also used as a Project Accelerator. There are a number of techniques to accelerate a project and various tools work depending on the situation. This tool is used to keep track of resources on the team to get the best results in the shortest amount of time. ","316 STEPS 1.List all stakeholder names on the team. Other stakeholders are the community, customers, stockholders, but are not included in this exercise. 2.Provide a number of 1-5 to indicate their CURRENT and DESIRED willingness to embrace change and make cultural commitment to advocate the change. Note that not all members may need to be a 4 or 5, but since a major breakthrough, technical, or cultural change requires a team effort it is important to have the core team neutral or better before starting or proceeding to the next step. ● 1 = Strong Resistance ● 2 = Resistance ● 3 = Neutral ● 4 = Willing To Change ● 5 = Strong willingness to accept and embrace change 3. Document the roles and the relationships members that impact one another, boss, co-worker, material handler, and operators. 4. Develop a plan to get individuals to desired rating quickly. If the plan is not working the person may need to be replaced before proceeding. The Stakeholder Analysis tool (similar to the Pareto Diagram) may be used at any time during any phase to gauge the member's positioning. Overuse might indicate a trust issue within the team. What is a Stakeholder? A stakeholder is someone who: Will have input into the product. These are generally internal people, but not always. These could include: ● Investors ● Subject matter experts ● Analysts ● Architects ","317 ● Developers ● Marketers ● Product owners ● Technical writers ● Testers ● Quality assurance. Will use the output of the product. These are usually external people. These could include: ● Customers ● End users ● Target audience. Stakeholder Map: A stakeholder map is a way to group and prioritize people. It’s based on a couple of key aspects: ● How much power they have. ● How much interest they have. A person with power can affect the direction of the project. A person with interest cares about the outcomes of the project. A basic stakeholder map looks like this: ","318 Tools to Help Identify Stakeholders Before you can add stakeholders to the map, you must identify them. RAPID Model The obvious answer to ‘who makes decisions?’ might seem to be, ‘the CEO!’ . Chances are, though, that this person isn’t making decisions in a vacuum. That would be a very inefficient way to operate. Most decision makers have people around them to help. These people: ● curate information. ● condense large numbers of options into the three or four most likely candidates. All of these helpers are involved in the decision making process. As such, they have substantial influence on it. The RAPID model helps you to classify and identify these people. Not just those who make decisions. Also those who contribute to decision making in an organization. It was developed and trademarked by Bain & Company. It includes five key roles: ● Recommend ● Agree ● Perform ● Input ● Decide. The Recommend role ","319 The Recommender is someone who has a good overall knowledge. They understand the subject of the decision. They: ● Gather information. ● Condense it into brief points for easy reading. ● Make suggestions based on it. For example, a company might be building software. It has to work out which cloud provider to use for this task. The CTO brings in the architect. This person has a decent working knowledge of all the big cloud platforms. They deliver a report detailing the pros and cons of each. Then they suggest one provider based on their knowledge of the software to be built. The Agree role The Agreer is complementary to the Recommender. They might not be experts, but they have a decent level of knowledge. They don’t gather or condense data. Instead, they work with the Recommender to support the suggestion. This might involve compromise to gain accord. For example, the architect reports to the CTO. The CTO takes the Agree role here. The architect must convince the CTO of the suggested option. Only then will the CTO take the report to the other C-level execs. The Perform role The Performer is a person who’ll turn the decision into reality. This is usually a team; more than one person. They take the decision and carry it out. For example, in our cloud software decision, the Performer could be coders and designers. They’ll turn an abstract decision into reality. They’ll use the platform to create a product. The Input role The Inputter provides information. This might be given to the Recommender or the Decider. The Inputter doesn’t make suggestions. Instead, they just provide the data. Someone else can use that to propose a course of action. For example, an Inputter might have training in cloud coding. They know best ","320 practices and have useful info to offer. The Decide role The Decider takes the data and proposals given by people in other roles. Then they make a final decision. They are accountable for the decision. They are also responsible for ensuring that they follow through. For example, a Decider could be a CEO or CTO. They have control of at least one team. They decide how and what the team should work on. Responsibility Assignment These models identify people involved in tasks. Basic RACI model In the basic RACI model, there are four roles people can take in tasks. The roles are: ● Responsible ● Accountable ","321 ● Consulted ● Informed. RACI charts clearly show: ● Who is involved in a task. ● What their role is. The Responsible role:This is the person doing the task. For example, a coder creating a specific feature. The Accountable role:This is the person overseeing the Responsible person. For example, a team leader. The Consulted role:This is the person who can provide help and info. For example, a system architect. The Informed role:This is the person who needs to be kept up to date on progress of the task. For example, the user who requested the feature. Alternatives To RACI There are a number of alternatives to the RACI participation types: RACI ROLES SHORTEN: Roles are the following - Responsible Does the work to complete the task - Accountable Delegates work and is the last one to review the task or deliverable before it's deemed complete - Consulted Provides input based on either how it will impact their future project work or their domain of expertise on the deliverable itself - Informed Needs to be kept in the loop on project progress, rather than roped into details of every deliverable PARIS This is an early version of a responsibility assignment matrix, with the roles defined as: ● Participant ● Accountable ● Review required ","322 ● Input required ● Sign-off required PACSI This is a version very useful to organizations where the output of activities under the accountability of a single person/function can be reviewed and vetoed by multiple stakeholders, due to the collaborative nature of the culture. ● Perform: The person/function carrying out the activity. ● Accountable: The person/function is ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, and often the one who delegates the work to the performer. ● Control: The person/function reviewing the result of the activity. They have a right of veto; their advice is binding. ● Suggest: The person/function consulted to give advice based upon recognized expertise. The advice is non-binding. ● Informed:The person/function who must be informed of the result of the activity. RASIC or RASCI This is an expanded version of the standard RACI, less frequently known as RASCI, breaking the responsible participation into: ● Responsible: Those responsible for the task, who ensure that it is done as per the approver ● Support:Resources allocated to responsible. Unlike consulted, who may provide input to the task, support helps complete the task. RASI This is an alternative version of the standard RACI, foregoing the consulted participation and replacing it with: ● Support: Resources which play a supporting role in implementation. ● RACIQ: This is an expanded version of the standard RACI, with an additional participation type: ● Quality review: Those who check whether the product meets the quality ","323 requirements. RACI-VS This is an expanded version of the standard RACI, with two additional participation types: Verifier: Those who check whether the product meets the acceptance criteria set forth in the product description. Signatory: Those who approve the verified decision and authorize the product hand- off. It seems to make sense that the signatory should be the party being accountable for its success. CAIRO This is an expanded version of the standard RACI, also known as RACIO with one additional participation type. Out of the loop (or omitted) Designating individuals or groups who are specifically not part of the task. Specifying that a resource does not participate can be as beneficial to a task's completion as specifying those who do participate. DACI Another version that has been used to centralize decision making, and clarify who can re-open discussions. Driver: A single driver of an overall project like the person steering a car. Approver: One or more approvers who make most project decisions, and are responsible if it fails. Contributors: Are the worker-bees who are responsible for deliverables; and with whom there is two-way communication. Informed: Those who are impacted by the project and are provided status and informed of decisions; and with whom there is one-way communication. RAPID ","324 Another tool used to clarify decision roles and thereby improve decision making, is RAPID, which was created by and is a registered trademark of Bain & Company. Recommend: The recommended role typically involves 80 percent of the work in a decision. The recommender gathers relevant input and proposes a course of action—sometimes alternative courses, complete with pros and cons so that the decision maker's choices are as clear, simple and timely as possible. Agree: The agreed role represents a formal approval of a recommendation. The 'A' and the 'R' should work together to come to a mutually satisfactory proposal to bring forward to the decider. But not all decisions will need an agreed role, as this is typically reserved for those situations where some form of regulatory or compliance sign-off is required. Perform: The perform role defines who is accountable for executing or implementing the decision once it is made. Best-practice companies typically define P's and gather input from them early in the process. Input: The input role provides relevant information and facts so that the recommender and decider can assess all the relevant facts to make the right decision. However, the 'I' role is strictly advisory. Recommenders should consider all input, but they don't have to reflect every point of view in the final recommendation. Decide: The deciding role is for the single person who ultimately is accountable for making the final decision, committing the group to action and ensuring the decision gets implemented. RATSI Another tool used in organization design or roles analysis. Responsibility: Identify who is in charge of making sure the work is done. Authority: Identify who has final decision power on the work. Task:Identify who actually does the work. Support:Identify who is involved to provide support to the work. Informed: Identify who is informed that the work has been done (or will be started) DRASCI ","325 A variant of RASCI developed by three Whitehall theorists (Kane, Jackson, Gilbert). This scheme is adapted for use in matrix management environments, and differs only from RASCI in having an additional role of Driver and a narrower definition of Support: Driver: An individual or party that assists those who are responsible for delivering a task by both producing supporting collateral and setting timescales for delivery in line with the overarching aim of the individual or party who is accountable for the overall accomplishment of the objective. The distinction between driver and support lies in that the former reinforces and clarifies the parameters of the task on behalf of those who are accountable, while the latter refers to those who help those who are responsible in reaching a given goal. PDQA A version developed at U Tokyo and MIT for model-based project management. The PDQA set of roles corresponds to demand for capabilities of teams. Roles include those for work on scope, handling of dependencies as coordination, and exception handling through error detection and decisions across a project organization. PDQA is used in agent-based modeling to simulate the supply of these capabilities by teams in projects. Primary: Provides skill-based effort within capacity to complete scope and also manages dependencies through coordination. Decision: Handles any decision, including scope acceptable and exception handling decisions leading to rework. (Does not generate nominal scope). Quality: Reviews scope as it progresses to detect poor quality and escalates to decision-maker as so. (Does not have a general nominal scope). Assist: Provides skill-based effort with the capacity to complete scope, in assistance to the primary. (Does not manage dependencies through coordination). DCI A minimal set of decision-making categories used in organization design or roles analysis. Decision maker: Individuals who make the decision and are accountable for its impact on the business. ","326 Consulted: Individuals accountable for providing guidance based on functional expertise and experience, highlighting issues and raising alternatives to support the Decision Maker. Informed: Impacted stakeholders are notified after the decision has been made and who will need to support the execution of the decision. RASCEIO To be used when working on governance, risk, compliance (GRC) and outsourcing matters: ● Responsible ● Accountable ● Support ● Consult ● Execute: Third parties contracted to execute activities in accordance with a service level agreement ● Inform Overview Key GRC roles, such as risk owner, policy owner - where accountability is devolved, but a role is needed to oversee whether accountabilities all fit together. ","327 Benchmarking Benchmarking in Six Sigma involves a company analyzing its performance rather than measuring it against the standard set by the industry they work in or a world-class company in another industry. It typically focuses on processes and operations within one area of the company. Benchmarking does not mean directly comparing an operation against a competitor. For benchmarking, it’s about comparing one aspect of an operation against a best-in- class operation. For example, a medical clinic might measure its customer service performance based on key metrics, then measure those same metrics at a retail company known as a standard-setter in customer service. They then can easily see where they fall short and strive to make improvements in those areas. The key steps involved with benchmarking include: Measure current practices: Teams determine an area where the company is underperforming. They then measure key performance indicators to see where they currently stand. Research best practices: After measuring their own performance, businesses then measure those same key metrics in whatever operation or process they want to improve (for example, handling customer complaints or generating new sales leads) Collect data: Teams analyze how companies achieve a high standard in the key ","328 metrics. This often requires touring the world-class organization’s operations or meeting with people from the organization. Compare performance: Teams then compare their operations with those of the world-class organization, finding areas where they can make improvements. These changes will help them achieve a higher standard in the key performance metrics. Benchmarking typically occurs within one of the following areas. Competitive benchmarking: A focus on competitors within the company’s own industry with a goal of establishing the standards set by industry leaders. Strategic benchmarking: Going outside the company’s industry to analyze how world-class organizations meet a higher standard. Internal benchmarking: In larger companies, one area that has achieved a high standard will share its best practices with other areas of the operation. When you mention the word “benchmarking” how do ordinary people process it? Moreover, what’s “ordinary”? That sounds like a good subject for benchmarking. Someone building a computer may think of microprocessors and memory modules. These metrics change when you want to get the fastest processor and reliable memory that you can afford. However, life gets easier when we turn to the benchmarking sites. But alas, what do we find when we look deeply into the details? We see all sorts of irregularities. Different systems used for different memory modules. Well, that means different buses and different processors, which can really skew the results. Not to mention differences in temperature on identical systems when you test several modules in a row. Business Growth The same happens to executives in their normal lives. A decision-maker that is unfamiliar with six-sigma needs to know what to do first. This dilemma is especially the case in start-ups and small companies ready to grow and be competitive on a larger scale. ","329 Executives rely on their own experiences. Benchmarking gets confused with competitor analysis. In competitor analysis, how can you find all of the critical details? Who will share these details? So, the executive committee performs an ad-hoc analysis. Perhaps opinions are gathered from subject matter experts in the company. And even when you make critical decisions, you notice no improvements. Many companies fail at this point. Now here comes the Six Sigma professional, that jack of all trades in the misunderstood world of Continuous Improvement. We know the deal; the right tools for the right job. Competitor analysis has its time and place, but that comes after a company’s processes are well-established. So that’s where benchmarking comes in. Purpose of Benchmarking in Six Sigma Benchmarking is a method that companies use to compare the performance of their output to that of a standard. The process of benchmarking is performed as a Six-Sigma DMAIC project. During the measurement phase, the “company” benchmarks the “standard.” The standard may be a compliance standard used in the business, or it may be an industry leader. For this discussion, the standard will be an industry leader. It’ll have similar outputs, but a different customer base. The standard may be a vendor or a customer, but not a competitor. Outputs may be a process, a service, or a product. Benchmarking is not competitor research that compares the performance of a competitor company to gain an advantage. It’s a process of comparing your processes with an industry leader to learn how to be better. Benchmarking affords a competitive edge through the development of best practices. So it focuses on the best ways to meet customer needs. ","330 Types of Benchmarking Benchmarking comes in four types: 1. Strategic: This benchmark investigates how companies compete in the marketplace. The company and the standard may be from different industries. Albeit, the competitive positioning within an industry should be the same. 2. Project: This benchmark investigates techniques, such as project management and product introduction. Again, the company and the standard can come from different industries. Development cycles should be similar in complexity and time. 3. Performance: This benchmark is an assessment of competitive positioning. The focus would be either on price or quality. A company can rarely be competing while focusing on both. 4. Process: The process is the actual work. It may concentrate on best-operating practices, customer service, or manufacturing. Benchmarking Process and Analysis Choosing the right company to use as the benchmarking standard is critical. Benchmarking includes site visits, interviews, and documentation of processes. So knowing the best standard requires you to understand the desired type of benchmark. You must clearly define and document the scope and desired outcome. It’s crucial to ensure that there will be no competitive issues, as trust is paramount to the exchange of information. Transparency from the very beginning will help ensure the best benchmarking experience. Numerous resources outline the benchmarking process and the many forms. Adopting the following guidelines is a great place to start: 1. Document performance gaps These are performance gaps that compare the current state to an ideal future state. If this state was fully understood, benchmarking might not be necessary. So a lack of parameters should be a reason for benchmarking. ","331 2. Prepare the case for benchmarking Think ahead and have a framework in place for the get-well plan. Be able to support the need for benchmarking. Consult with other business units that may provide insight, like finance and sales. Speak to functional managers to see what their team load is. Think about what speaks to executives. Be ready to show the business case. 3. Obtain executive approval A complete buy-in is essential. The approval process will afford internal collaboration and maximize the benefit to the company. Be sure to engage with the executive team at all steps. 4. Determine the project team members These members include all key stakeholders as with any DMAIC project. Don’t forget to confer with the key decision-makers. Identify the champion if the executive team has not assigned one. 5. Determine the benchmarking objectives and scope The project team determines the benchmarking range and aims to make sure that everyone benefits. Examples of objectives include: ● Compare performance to an industry-standard ● Increase product performance ● Increase product quality ● Increase market share ● Reduce manufacturing cost ● Develop a measurement system ● Determine proper metrics 6. Write a benchmarking project plan and obtain executive approval Ensure that all stakeholders within the company are included. If you’ve included the key decision-makers to this point, you’ll get approval naturally. If your company has a project plan template, use it. Ask the executives what they need to see to approve the decision. ","332 7. Document the current state The current state, without improvements, is the process to be benchmarked to the standard. Don’t waste time on data collection. Do not include any ideas for optimization. Include all stakeholders and functions. This is an excellent time for a Kaizen. 8. Agree on metrics The metrics must be relative to the objective and within the scope. At this point, you should be beginning to map the future state. 9. Put the metrics in writing Elements should include: ● What is to be measured ● What should not be measured ● Precision of measurements ● Method of measurement ● Repeatability and Reproducibility standards (Gage R&R) ● Methods of calculation ● Measurement examples 10. Measure the current state You may already know the current state, depending on the metrics chosen. Document the measurements for comparison to the future state. 11. Find a benchmarking partner Your benchmarking partner, in this case, the industry leader, is identified as the standard. The process may involve extensive research and a lot of foot-work. So revisiting the metrics may be necessary. Remember, the future state is fluid because it is yet unknown. 12. Write the benchmarking plan This will be a clear project plan made in partnership with key contacts; the industry leader. The scope of the interviews should be clearly defined. So identify and document your questions. ","333 Determine who you’ll interview. Collaborate with your contact at the industry leader. This plan will have a significant effect on your relationship with the industry leader. 13. Conduct site visits and interviews Do not deviate from the benchmarking plan. You may obtain further information via consensual collaboration. Albeit, you should agree on all partnerships in advance and writing. 14. Apply the lessons learned and measure performance metrics Elements of the metrics should be the same as measured before the benchmarking visit. Any new parameters should be discussed separately from the “current state” established before the benchmarking. 15. Document findings and communicate with executives This is a great use of your project champion. Communication should occur immediately after analyzing results. Findings include both negative and positive results. Include implementation plans and potential further studies. Keep the executives engaged. Be prepared to make more changes and measurements before moving forward. 16. Determine the best implementations for improvement The entire project team defined in the project charter. Include the project champion to expedited executive approval. 17. Obtain executive consent for the implementation Build upon the original project plan. Show the original “current state” and the now “future state.” Have a project plan in place, with milestones and expectations. Then identify all the process owners and stakeholders needed to implement the improvements. 18. Implement and control the improvements Collaborate closely with the process owners during the improve and control phases. This is critical for any Six-Sigma DMAIC project to ensure lasting and effective results. A process owner is a person responsible for the process, product or service that was ","334 benchmarked, or that was modified due to the benchmarking project. You have to document the new process in sufficient detail. You might need to arrange for training programs. 19. Report on the outcome of the improvements once you’ve achieved a steady- state This step is critical. You must make a fair comparison, so the real benefit is known. You may choose to do this at a steady-state, or when you’ve collected enough data. It’s more informal than getting executive approval. A good report will increase the chances of future project approvals. 20. Celebrate Yes, the often-forgotten celebration. It was a lot of hard work and extra time from a lot of people. Let them know you appreciate them. Give them credit, so they’ll want to say “yes” to working on your next project. Benchmarking Code of Conduct Benchmarking with an industry leader is a collaboration. So, the company must guard the intellectual property and trade secrets of the standard. ● Treat confidential information with the utmost care. ● Use the information only as agreed. ● Don’t get into any conversations that seem illegal, such as pricing methods. ● Only contact personnel after obtaining permission from key collaborators. ● Be well prepared and have a plan. ● Treat interactions as an exchange of ideas, not as an investigation. ● Seek clarifications rather than filling in the blanks. ● Above all, be respectful. Benchmarking Examples Benchmarking studies come in innumerable forms. The American Society for Quality has a couple of freely available reports on the Global State of Quality Research. The landing page is a good representation of the first page of an executive presentation. Always be prepared to show only one slide to executives. A thorough example is beyond the scope of this article. The interested reader can request the complete ","335 package without obligation. An example from my past is informative and straightforward. I had the task of developing a measurement laboratory for bimetal products for an electronics components company. The methods for reliability testing of bimetals were mostly hidden in proprietary knowledge of a few companies. The marketing team identified a few possible partners in China. So I worked on documenting the current capabilities of the company and the metrics needed. This endeavor was a large one, as would be expected. We had extensive documentation on what we envisioned the future state to be. The company was sophisticated and had a lot of resources — one of the world’s leading bimetal companies. So armed with a list of key questions and the right person to talk to, we prepared for the site visit. I’ll always remember the surprise I felt at the little test done. The testing equipment was like something out of an old science fiction movie. I soon realized why no one on the team could find extensive testing standards. They didn’t exist. It was an old, proven, reliable technology. It was great news and a great lesson learned. The company didn’t have to spend a single dollar on new equipment. Only a few minor changes to inexpensive, disposable test boards were the extent of the future state. Yes, and some documentation and training. The Lesson The lesson learned was don’t over-prepare in the face of uncertainty. In all fairness, the industry leader would not allow us on site until we had a thorough testing plan. So, it was not a complete waste of time for this case. In reality, it was a win-win. We obtained the information about the old technology we needed from an industry leader while they got detailed insight into the modern testing methods of an industry leader. In every case, the sooner the collaboration, even with only one stakeholder from the industry leader, the better. ","336 Performance Measures (PMS) Improvement in individual, group, or organizational performance cannot occur unless there is some way of getting performance feedback. Feedback is having the outcomes of work communicated to the employee, work group, or company. For an individual employee, performance measures create a link between their own behavior and the organization's goals. For the organization or its work unit's performance measurement is the link between decisions and organizational goals. It has been said that before you can improve something, you have to be able to measure it, which implies that what you want to improve can somehow be quantified. Additionally, it has also been said that improvement in performance can result just from measuring it. Whether or not this is true, measurement is the first step in improvement. But while measuring is the process of quantification, its effect is to stimulate positive action. Managers should be aware that almost all measures have negative consequences if they are used incorrectly or in the wrong situation. Managers have to study the environmental conditions and analyze these potential negative consequences before adopting performance measures. TYPES OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES Performance measures can be grouped into two basic types: those that relate to results (outputs or outcomes such as competitiveness or financial performance) and those that focus on the determinants of the results (inputs such as quality, flexibility, resource utilization, and innovation). This suggests that performance measurement frameworks can be built around the concepts of results and determinants. Measures of performance of a business usually embrace five fundamental, but interlinking areas: ● Money, usually measured as profit ● Output/input relationships or productivity ● Customer emphasis such as quality ● Innovation and adaptation to change ● Human resources Within the operations area, standard individual performance measures could be ","337 productivity measures, quality measures, inventory measures, lead-time measures, preventive maintenance, performance to schedule, and utilization. Specific measures could include: ● Cost of quality: measured as budgeted versus actual. ● Variances: measured as standard absorbed cost versus actual expenses. ● Period expenses: measured as budgeted versus actual expenses. ● Safety: measured on some common scale such as number of hours without an accident. ● Profit contribution: measured in dollars or some common scale. ● Inventory turnover: measured as actual versus budgeted turnover. While financial measures of performance are often used to gauge organizational performance, some firms have experienced negative consequences from relying solely on these measures. Traditional financial measures are better at measuring the consequences of yesterday's actions than at projecting tomorrow's performance. Therefore, it is better that managers not rely on one set of measures to provide a clear performance target. Many firms still rely on measures of cost and efficiency, when at times such indicators as time, quality, and service would be more appropriate measures. To be effective, performance yardsticks should continuously evolve in order to properly assess performance and focus resources on continuous improvement and motivating personnel. In order to incorporate various types of performance measures some firm's develop performance measurement frameworks. These frameworks appear in the literature and vary from Kaplan and Norton's balanced scorecard to Fitzgerald's framework of results and determinants. Kaplan and Norton's balanced scorecard approach operates from the perspective that more than financial data is needed to measure performance and that nonfinancial data should be included to adequately assess performance. They suggest that any performance measurement framework should allow managers to ask the following questions: ● How do we look to our shareholders? (financial perspective) ● What must we excel at? (internal business perspective) ● How do our customers see us? (customer perspective) ","338 ● How can we continue to improve and create value? (innovation and learning perspective) However, the balanced scorecard is flawed as it does not allow for one of the most important questions of all: ● • What are our competitors doing? (the competitor perspective) Keegan proposed a similar, but lesser known, performance measurement framework titled the \"performance matrix.\" The performance matrix is more flexible, as it is able to integrate different dimensions of performance, and employs generic terms such as internal, external, cost, and noncost. DESIGNING THE PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT SYSTEM A number of suggestions have been offered by various experts on the subject of designing performance measurement systems. Below is a list of suggestions derived from a number of these experts. Some of these apply to all measures and some apply to a limited number of a firm's measures. A firm's performance measures should: ● Be simple and easy to use. ● Have a clear purpose. ● Provide fast feedback. ● Cover all the appropriate elements (internal, external, financial and nonfinancial). ● Relate to performance improvement, not just monitoring. ● Reinforce the firm's strategy. ● Relate to both long-term and short-term objectives of the organization. ● Match the firm's organization culture. ● Not conflict with one another. ● Be integrated both horizontally and vertically in the corporate structure. ● Be consistent with the firm's existing recognition and reward system. ● Focus on what is important to customers. ● Focus on what the competition is doing. ● Lead to identification and elimination of waste. ● Help accelerate organizational learning. ● Help build a consensus for change when customer expectations shift or ","339 strategies and priorities call for the organization to behave differently. ● Evaluate groups not individuals for performance to schedule. ● Establish specific numeric standards for most goals. ● Be available for constant review. Other recommendations for organizations that are developing performance measures include: 1. Data collection and methods of calculating the performance measure must be clearly defined. 2. Objective performance criteria are preferable to subjective ones. 3. Recognize that measures may vary between locations; avoid a \"one size fits all\" mentality. Wisner and Fawcett provide a nine-step process for developing a performance measurement system: 1. Clearly define the firm's mission statement. 2. Identify the firm's strategic objectives using the mission statement as a guide (profitability, market share, quality, cost, flexibility, dependability, and innovation). 3. Develop an understanding of each functional area's role in achieving the various strategic objectives. 4. For each functional area, develop global performance measures capable of defining the firm's overall competitive position to top management. 5. Communicate strategic objectives and performance goals to lower levels in the organization. Establish more specific performance criteria at each level. 6. Assure consistency with strategic objectives among the performance criteria used at each level. 7. Assure the compatibility of performance measures used in all functional areas. 8. Use the performance measurement system to identify competition, locate problem areas, assist the firm in updating strategic objectives and making tactical decisions to achieve these objectives, and supply feedback after the decisions are implemented. 9. Periodically reevaluate the appropriateness of the established performance measurement system in view of the current competitive environment. Finally, it is important that the performance measurement systems used by managers be continually reviewed and revised as the environment and economy ","340 changes. Failure to make the necessary modifications can inhibit the ability of the organization to be an effective and efficient global competitor. Key Performance Indicators A key performance indicator is a value that measures the effectiveness of a company in achieving its business objectives. These KPIs are essential for evaluating the success of the Lean Six Sigma program within an organization. Top 9 KPIs have been listed and explained below that are measured by garment manufacturers (export houses) in the apparel industry. Analysis of these KPIs is carried out monthly. 1. Factory Efficiency Percentage Factory efficiency indicates how efficiently sewing lines are run in a factory. This indicator is important because the capacity planning of the factory and projected garment making cost is done based on factory efficiency. Factory efficiency includes all lines minutes produced and total hours attended by direct labor in sewing floor. Target factory efficiency varies based on the order quantity. For the detailed calculation of efficiency refer to ‘how to calculate the efficiency of a production line or batch?” For factory efficiency – calculate total minutes produced by all lines and total minutes attended by all lines. Factory efficiency% = (Total minutes produced X 100)/Total minutes attended. 2. Man to Machine Ratio: When it is the factory's Man to Machine ratio (MMR), every employee of the factory is considered under manpower. So, Man: Machine= Total manpower: Total sewing machines available in the factory (machines those are in use). For example, if a factory has 500 sewing machines and total manpower of the factory is 1100 then man to machine ratio =1100:500 OR 2.2. This ratio varies product to product and on organization structure. ","341 3. Cut to ship ratio: This is a ratio of total cut quantity and total shipped quantity of an order. This indicator is measured order wise and monthly shipped orders. To keep a buffer (for damaged, defective garments) the factory cuts extra pieces than order quantity. For example, the factory received an order of 20000 pieces, cut quantity 20200 pieces (1% extra cutting) and total shipped quantity 20000 pieces. Cut : Ship = 20200:20000 = 1.01. This indicator is measured to control surplus quantity after shipment, reduction in extra cutting and damaged garment. Target Cut to ship ratio is 1. 4. Order to ship ratio The buyer expects to receive a full quantity from the supplier that has been ordered. This is the most important factor that buyers use for vendor evaluation. This indicator is calculated as = Total order quality/ Total shipped quantity. The target of Order to Ship ratio is always 1. It is good if the factory can ship higher than order quantity (only if the buyer accepts extra quantity). 5. On time delivery rate How much shipment did not meet target shipment date is analyzed at the end of each month? Target on-time delivery of each style is to meet shipment delivery date. If not meet reasons for not meeting delivery dates are analyzed. It is calculated as = Total orders shipped on time/Total orders shipped in the month. For example, if factory shipped 18 styles on time out of total 20 styles shipped in a month then On time delivery of that month is =18/20*100% = 90% 6. Average style change over time The time gap between the previous style over (last piece out from the line) and first piece output of the current style is known as style change over time. Shorter changeover time is considered a better performance level. It varies from style to style and production systems. Time of Change over time of each style is recorded and an average changeover time of the factory is measured. ","342 7. Right First Time (RFT) quality This indicator is represented in percentages. Total audits passed for the first time out of total audits conducted by auditors. Right first time quality is measured in various stages of garment processing and analysis is done audit wise. Higher values (percentage) of right first time quality is considered as better performance of the factory. 8. Quality of Production: The quality level of each department is measured in DHU and Percentage defective units. Higher the value of DHU, higher alteration time and higher cost incurred in quality. 9. Downtime percentage: Downtime is one of the topmost reasons for less factory efficiency. Factory analyses major down times to control and improve machine and operator utilization. Top 5 reasons for downtime (also known as non-productive time, Off-standard time) are line setting, operation sitting idle, no feeding, machine breakdown and no planning for a line. Why are KPIs important? A business is no different. Without targets (aka Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), how can a company know how well (or badly) it is performing? Without KPIs how will a company know what to improve? Even more important, without KPIs how will a company know the priority of improvements to have the greatest impact on their bottom line. Ineffective targets usually fall into one of three categories: ● Fuzzy target(s) ","343 ● No target(s) (or not knowing that there is a target) ● Wrong target(s) ● Too many targets Fuzzy Targets What if the target you were shooting at was really “fuzzy” and it was hard to see where you are aiming? This is a common problem in most organizations. They have KPIs that can be interpreted differently by different people. For example, “On-time Delivery” can be measured from different origination points and different endpoints. Because we don’t truly know the target, we aim at where we think the target is. No target(s) (or not knowing that there is a target) Wrong target(s) What happens if you aim at the wrong target? ","344 For example, many companies use “Efficiency” as a target. Efficiency is normally calculated as the Number of Units Produced divided by the Cost to Produce the Units. Too Many target(s) What makes Good Targets (or KPIs)? ","345 Below are the characteristics (in our experience) that make an effective KPI: ● They must be clear, simple, well-defined and measurable ● They should always cascade down to sites and departments from the overall strategic goals of an organization ● They should be communicated throughout your organization and department(s). ● The KPIs should be focused on customer requirements and demand ● The employees that are governed by the KPIs should know how to achieve an effective outcome (i.e., the KPIs must be achievable) ● They should be consistently evaluated and improved Why are Targets (or KPIs) important to a Continuous Improvement Effort? ● KPIs help an organization to understand its performance levels at all levels of the company ● Knowing the performance levels help to focus the right continuous improvement projects in the right areas of the company ● KPIs help align and prioritize Lean Six Sigma ● Six Sigma Definition: Six Sigma is a set of techniques and t... ● projects to the site, departmental and organization’s strategic goals. ● KPIs help to sustain improvements by giving us a visual scorecard to show whether an improvement is maintained. ● KPIs provide a basis for recognizing organizational, team and individual performance. ","346 Key Behavior Index (KBI) “The only thing of real importance that leaders do is to create and manage culture. If you do not manage culture, it manages you, and you may not even be aware of the extent to which this is happening. – Professor Edgar Schein of the MIT Sloan School of Management.” Key Behavior Indicators: five steps in the right direction Step 1: The very first question you must ask as a leader is: what culture do you want in your organization? The desired culture is a collection of all the desired behaviors you want to see, from the CEO to an operator. ","347 Step 2: Translate the ideal behavior so that it is relevant to the entire organization. Co-creation is a success factor: involve managers and employees in the decision- making process. Communicate about the kind of behavior you expect within your organization and work with the employees to determine how this ideal behavior translates into their daily tasks within the department/team. People can only be expected to display this desired behavior if they really understand what is expected from them. Step 3: While measuring results, also measure the ideal behavior that you want to see. Performance is often measured using KPIs: for example, growth in market share, customer satisfaction, turnover, etc. We find it perfectly logical to implement the ideal process from a blueprint and to measure the performance using performance indicators. But do we also find it logical to do the same for the most basic element of our organization, our culture? Of course, it is very important to measure results and to monitor KPIs, but is it also important to monitor how our behavior is evolving in the right direction? For example, it is possible that zero safety incidents occurred at a particular production site in the past year; but if no safety inspections have been carried out, or preventive measures taken to ensure safety (or even increase safety), this historical figure has no predictive value. It is certainly very interesting to know the extent of any savings that have been made as a result of the implementation of improvement ideas, but how many of these ideas were initiated by employees? Besides the usual KPIs, we should also have KBIs – Key Behavior Indicators. These should be used to see the extent to which the behavior we want to see in the organization is already present. An additional advantage of these indicators is that they often have a “leading” character: they are a predictor of future performance. Step 4: Visualize these Key Behavior Indicators as measurement points As a result of our intention to visualize, our success rate increases from 4% to 40%. Visualizing makes it clear what is important. Hang a white board with the measurement points on the wall in all departments; take the measurement points ","348 to existing platforms such as the daily start-up meeting or weekly/monthly performance meetings. The Key Behavior Indicators are signposts showing the way to the ideal behavior that will achieve the ideal results. So it is very important that they belong on your Balanced Scorecard. Step 5: Go to the Gemba A presence on the floor is important, but simply being present is not enough. Now the ideal behavior is known, a Gemba walk no longer has to be an unstructured walk around. Look and observe whether you perceive the ideal behavior, and try to find out whether there is a difference between the current behavior and the desired behavior. Your Gemba walk is actually a manifestation of your belief and subsequent behavior: that value is created on the floor and that managers should spend a significant amount of their time walking around: observing, asking questions, appreciating. Do you know what behavior you want to see in your organization already? Do your employees already know it? Gandhi said, “Be the change you want to see in the world”. We can start with, “Know the change you want to see in your organization”. ","349 Operational Excellence by Shingo Model For organizations to be successful over the long term, leaders must deeply and personally understand the principles that govern their success. Furthermore, they must ensure the behaviors of every person who contributes to the business are in harmony with these principles. In short, the organizational culture they build must be grounded in correct principles. Principles of Operational Excellence The principles are categorized into four dimensions: ● D-1: Cultural enablers, ● D-2: Continu-ous process improvement, ● D-3: Enterprise alignment and ● D-4: Results – the ultimate end of all business initiatives. These four di-mensions overlay five core business systems: product/service development, customer relations, operations, supply and a variety of management or admin-istrative support systems.Guiding PrinciplesThe Shingo Prize for ","350 Operational Excel-lence has 10 guiding princi-ples of operational excellence. Sr Guiding Principle Meaning 1 Lead with Humanity A leader’s willingness to seek input, listen carefully and continu-ously learn creates an environment where associates feel respected and energized and give freely of their creative abilities. 2 Respect for Individual Respect is a principle that enables the development of people and creates an environment for empowered associates to improve the processes that they “own.” This principle is stated in the context of “every individual” rather than “for people” as a group. 3 Focus on Process Good processes will produce the in-tended output, as long as proper inputs are provided. Process focus also helps focus prob-lem-solving efforts on processes rather than people. A complete shift to pro-cess focus eliminates the tendency to find the culprit (person) who made the mistake but rather leads to a pursuit of the real culprit (process) that allowed the mistake to be made. ","351 4 Embrace Scientific Thinking All associates can be trained to use scientific thinking to im-prove the processes with which they work, creating a culture that provides common understanding, approach and language regarding improvement. There are a variety of models for sci-entific thinking, such as PDCA (plan, do, check and adjust), the QC Story, A3 thinking and DMAIC (define, measure, analyze, improve and control). 5 Flow and Pull Value Flow is the best driver to make processes faster, easier, cheaper and better. Pull is the concept of matching the rate of production to the level of demand, the goal in any environment. Flow and pull create enormous positive benefits in all aspects in any business. 6 Assure Quality at the Source 0.00034%Assuring quality at the source is the combination of three important concepts: (1) do not pass defects forward, (2) stop and fix problems and (3) respect the individual in the process. Organizations must commit to stopping and fixing processes that are creating defects, rather than keeping products or services moving while planning to fix the issue later. 7 Seek Perfection This explains Dr. Shingo’s philosophy that one should always look for problems where there doesn’t appear to be any. This is contrary to the traditional belief: “If it isn’t broken, don’t fix it.” The pursuit of perfection reveals that there are always opportunities for improvement. ","352 8 Create Constancy of Purpose Almost every aspect of any organiza-tion is always in a constant state of change. Even knowing this, the first of W. Edwards Deming’s “14 Points” is to create constancy of purpose. How is this possible? Purpose, at the highest level answers the question: “Why does this organization exist?” It is incumbent upon leaders to find agreement on philosophical and strategic direction that provides a uni-fying vision. This sense of direction helps people keep their eyes on the horizon so that when tactical decisions require a temporary detour, they understand why and can contribute to getting back on track. 9 Think Systemically Leaders realize that the impact of syn-ergy — how things work together — is far greater than the sum of the parts. As managers design and align systems with correct principles, they must shift from thinking purely analytically to think-ing systemically. 10 Create Value for the Customer Every aspect of an organization should be focused on creating value for the customer. It is helpful to consider this true-north concept that should guide decision making and continuous im-provement. An organization should drive all aspects of value, including quality, cost, delivery, safety and morale. The Loyalty Matrix Walker’s Loyalty Matrix is a framework for measuring loyalty and assessing the stability of an organization’s customer base. This versatile approach provides businesses with a practical means to leverage the voice of the customer for improved business performance. MAKING LOYALTY ACTIONABLE Taking action is widely mentioned as the top challenge in a customer listening ","353 initiative or voice-of-the-customer strategy. One method to making customer loyalty more actionable is to begin with a good framework. The Loyalty Matrix is a very practical framework that segments customers into four groups based on their responses to a small battery of questions. The two axes in the matrix represent the two key aspects of loyalty – behavior (what a customer plans to do) and attitude (how they feel about working with your company). This forms the following four quadrants: TRULY LOYAL – These customers have every intention of continuing to do business with you and they have a positive attitude towards your company. They like working with you and are more likely to increase their spending and recommend your company to others. ACCESSIBLE – These customers have a good attitude about working with you but do not plan to continue their relationship. Since this is a rather odd combination, it’s not surprising that it is often a very small percentage of customers. It typically means something has changed in their business and they do not need your product or services any longer. TRAPPED – These customers show every indication of continuing business with you, but they’re not very happy about it. They feel trapped in the relationship. This is common among organizations that are locked into a long-term contract, lack a suitable substitute, or find it too hard to switch. Eventually, trapped customers will find a better option. HIGH RISK – As the name implies, these customers do not intend to return and don’t really like working with you anyway. Typically, they’re halfway out the door and not only will they no longer be a customer, but will also talk poorly about your company in the marketplace. Many organizations use this framework and find it to be more versatile, more practical, and much more actionable than satisfaction scores, NPS, or other approaches. ","354 LEVERAGING LOYAL CUSTOMERS You have lots of loyal customers. But, what do you do to make the most of these relationships? First, let’s describe what we really mean when we talk about loyal customers. As described in the framework of the Loyalty Matrix, truly loyal customers are those that are positive in both their attitude and behavior. In other words, they have every intention of continuing to do business with you and they have a positive attitude toward your company. They like working with you and are more likely to increase their spending and recommend your company to others. Then what strategies and tactics should be deployed to leverage loyal customer relationships? Here are four key initiatives that every company can incorporate into their customer strategies: 1. Support new sales – in most businesses referrals are a key component in closing new deals. Because loyal customers have a positive attitude about their work with you, they are an excellent source of referrals and testimonials. 2. Earn more business – loyal customers typically are planning to increase their spending. This is a chance to up-sell and cross-sell to generate new sales. 3. Team up to innovate – loyal customers are often the best partners. They will be more open and interested in collaborating to consider and test new solutions. 4. Network with other customers – ideally, you want their loyalty to be contagious. Encouraging networking between loyal customers and trapped customers can help convert these trapped customers and earn more loyalty. Too often, when a company looks at the breakdown of their customers in the Loyalty Matrix framework they focus on the negative - how to improve relationships with high risk and trapped customers. Unfortunately, the positive aspect can be overlooked – how to leverage relationships with their most loyal customers. And yet, this may be the quickest way to generate new revenue for the company! Applications of the Loyalty Matrix The Loyalty Matrix provides a rich, multi-dimensional, actionable approach to measuring loyalty. It goes beyond a simple customer satisfaction score, Net Promoter score or similar metric, to provide a richer source of information. One of ","355 the greatest aspects of the matrix is its flexibility and how it can be applied to a variety of business situations. Walker clients have used the Loyalty Matrix to: ● provide an ongoing snapshot of overall customer stability ● filter by geographic region so performance comparisons can be made ● filter by branch, store, or other business unit to create benchmarks for performance ● provide a breakdown of loyalty by product or solution ● link to other customer metrics, such as revenue and profitability ● link to operational metrics, such as delivery time or quality ● provide more accurate forecasting and account planning of future business with current customers ● establish a more precise understanding of the relationship within strategic accounts ● assess loyalty by individual contact within an account so that intra-account defection risk can be understood and strategies can be developed to improve specific relationships ● provide a snapshot of employee loyalty ● bridge the gap between macro-level initiatives that will impact perceptions of all customers vs. micro-level strategies and tactics designed to maximize the impact on a single account A Superior Framework What differentiates the Loyalty Matrix from other methods in the marketplace? Here are the key factors that separate the Loyalty Matrix from other alternatives: Scientifically sound but practical – While the science of the Loyalty Matrix is complex, the method by which the information is communicated and used is simple to comprehend. Multifaceted – Humans are complex beings; as such, it is counterintuitive to assume that their motivations and behaviors can be explained by a single metric. By embracing these complexities, the Loyalty Matrix provides a more robust understanding of customers. A blend of the means and the ends – By understanding the attitudes of customers (the means), we can better predict how they will behave (the ends) in both the short- and long-run. ","356 Action-oriented – Simply telling a client that the key to better financial success is to satisfy more customers or create more promoters leaves more questions than answers. Being able to understand the attitudes and intended behavior of the customer, coupled with the granularity provided with the underlying experience data provides a rich framework by which strategies and action plans can be developed. Leading & Lagging Indicators “In strategic planning it is important to discuss key performance indicators (KPI). The first step to determining your KPI is to understand the difference between lagging and leading indicators. The second step is to define and monitor your business indicators. Lagging and Leading Indicators.” - May 27, 2014 - Project Times Both leading and lagging indicators can occur at approximately the same time and there are circumstances where the leading and lagging indicators may not be easily identified. Today we will review definitions, examples and how to recognize the differences. By doing so, we hope to help you improve Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to make better decisions. Definitions: Indicator: An indicator is anything that can be used to predict future financial or economic trends. Leading Indicator: These types of indicators signal future events. Leading indicators are measures that lead to the performance of lag measures; normally measuring intermediate processes and activities. Often you will hear “what drives results?” when talking about leading indicators. Leading Indicator Examples: ● Amount of sales in the pipeline at 90% ● Customer complaints three-month trend ● Number of leads created ● Contracts in negotiation for Q3 ","357 ● Average handle time ● Number of leads converted to opportunities ● Customer cases currently open ● Team closing ratio ● Average speed of answer ● Number of contacts Leading indicators may prove difficult to identify and capture. With new measures there is no history within the organization. Attention to leading indicators are an advantage since they are predictive in nature and allows an organization to make adjustments based on results. Lagging Indicator: A lagging indicator is one that follows an event. Lagging indicators focus on results at the end of a time period, normally characterizing historical performance. Lagging indicators can also be referred to as Key Results Indicator (KRI) Lagging Indicator Examples: ● Last month's P&L statement ● Q2 Revenue review ● Total problems ● # of units sold ● Call center calls completed within two minutes ● Total incidents ● # of different products sold ● Product returns in July ● Total customer contacts One of the advantages of lagging indicators is how easy they are to identify and capture. This often has teams focused primarily on these KRIs which are only one piece of the puzzle. Lagging indicators are historical in nature and do not reflect current activities. These measures lack predictive power. Caution: Quotas or goals should only be placed on lagging indicators, not on leading indicators. Placing a goal on a leading indicator may result in gaming the system which can generate the wrong results. ","358 Conversations about leading and lagging indicators may get slightly confusing as other terms, phrases and special lingo may be used. For example, when talking about leading indicators, many will refer to “performance indicators” and lagging indicators may be referred to as Key Results Indicators (KRIs). Goals and Compensation: It goes without saying that goals and incentives drive behaviors. Consider how you want to influence those desired behaviors. Develop processes, metrics which help to measure success and compensation to keep motivations aligned with goals. Don’t leave out the support analysis team. Develop a list of behaviors you hope to see from them as well. If you identify and document the desired behavior, it becomes the basis for future behavior. When choosing the right sales performance analytics to focus on and help their organizations grow, sales managers typically face the dilemma of focusing on lagging or leading indicators. Lagging indicators are typically “output” oriented, easy to measure but hard to improve or influence, while leading indicators are typically input oriented, hard to measure and easier to influence. Sales leaders ask questions such as: “Which KPIs do I want my team focused on that will best correlate to sales success?” If you focus primarily on lagging indicators, they may in fact be detrimental to success. Leading indicators can become a secret formula for improving sales productivity. If a sales team works together to discover which indicator(s) are most valuable as a core sales KPI, there is “buy-in”. This will increase the sales team’s ownership of their performance and offer better accountability at all levels. Leading indicators focus on the likelihood of achieving goals and what might occur in the future, serving as a predictor or a warning sign. The combination of leading and lagging indicators offers a bigger picture view of the operation. It also gives you a comprehensive look at your risk, and allows you to make changes to improve scenarios before lagging indicators come into effect. While both types of sales metrics are critical for any sales organization to track, the best companies study more leading sales metrics than lagging. ","359 Line of Sight Management One of the most important things business owners and CEOs must do to ensure effective collaboration in the organization is to communicate the overall vision to the employees. Department heads should be able to explain to employees the mission and strategies of the company and how their individual roles fit into the big picture. Sustainable success comes from a cohesive organization-wide strategy based on a clear understanding of ‘line of sight’ beyond departments. Understanding Line of Sight Management In simple terms, line of sight is all about effective internal communication. It is something that requires leaders in an organization to motivate the workforce towards a common goal by explaining to employees, not just the vision but also the contribution from their efforts. While this appears to be simple to understand, it is not so simple to execute. According to statistics, as much as 75 percent of the employees have a clear understanding of how their work matters to organizational objectives and are actively engaged. On the other hand, only one in four employees are engaged at organizations where such an understanding is not present. These numbers make it clear that a clear line of sight plays a big role in confirming employee value to the organization. When they understand the overall goals, are aware of the strategies used to achieve them, and feel positive about their contributions to making it a reality, businesses have better chances to succeed. Line of Sight Communication & Employee Engagement Clear communication of line of sight is one of the most powerful drivers for employee engagement. It is an important concept that relates to the ability of a worker to understand the relationship between elements driving business success and how they relate to their job. When employees come to the workplace with a clear vision of the connection between these components and can relate them to personal motivation, they are likely to be more engaged and find meaning in their work. Business leaders, with the help of managers and department heads, can communicate the components of the line of sight management. This requires that the leader himself is clear about how different engagement factors can grow strong ","360 and should be committed to a communication strategy that consistently reinforces the relationship between those components. Here are some ways businesses can improve the important components of light of sight management: ● Articulating a clear vision A lot of business leaders neglect the understanding their employees have about the company’s future. Articulating a vision of the business not just involves communicating the sales and profit goals of the coming years. A vision can be called clear only when all the employees understand why the company is active, what value it creates in customers’ lives, the principles guiding the culture and what its success means to employees, customers, and the world. All other engagement elements become significant only when the company vision is clear. ● Defining the business model An organization’s business model represents how it makes, grows, and sustains revenue. Business leaders should focus on identifying the leverage points in the revenue cycles of the business model. This involves defining the performance areas important for growth potential and the roles and results that need to be fulfilled to achieve success. Business leaders should then also communicate the roles and expectations to responsible employees so that they can relate their efforts to the achievement. This can happen only when a connection between the company’s overall vision and the business model is well reinforced. When employees cannot explain what their company’s business model is, it symbolizes the failure of the leadership. A clear communication strategy is key to explaining to employees the revenue model and how they can impact it. ● Defining the business strategy While the business model relates to how businesses drive revenue, the business strategy describes how it competes in the market with the model. The success of a business strategy depends on a performance-based culture defined by the leader. It is this culture that determines whether the business gets a competitive advantage in the marketplace. When the top executives in an organization successfully build and sustain a culture ","361 of performance that not only wins but also attracts the best talent, they can anticipate success. The factors driving success get deeply embedded in the workplace culture. The role of the CEO is to ensure everybody is clear about the business strategy to make such sustainable winnings possible. ● Recruiting to a role Current workforce statistics indicate that the world is facing a scarcity of skilled talent. The type of talent organizations need includes people who can join the business as catalysts – impacting the growth trajectory positively. Companies require individuals who don’t come to fill positions but aim to fulfill roles that create something meaningful. These people have unique abilities willing to spend their time on issues that impact the business strategy. As such individuals are not easily available, companies are facing tough competition. Business leaders must define such roles in the organization and communicate the connection to the business model, vision, and strategy. Everybody in the company should know what his/her role is and what success means for the specific role. Line of Sight Performance Management Managing the performance of Line of Sight is a powerful approach to business improvement. LOS enables businesses to bring the right changes into effect at the right time in the right manner to ensure sustainable business performance. In other words, Line of Sight performance management builds clear, visible links between company goals and objectives, the metrics and steps that guide towards the goals, and the initiatives taking place at the workplace. Most importantly, Line of Sight performance management provides the leaders powerful navigational tools to retain focus throughout the process of achieving organizational goals. The performance improvement delivers a comprehensive assistance system aimed to help you achieve the desired business outcomes. Some of the most crucial elements of the Light of Sight performance management include: ● Defining and clarifying objectives and priorities of the business or department ● Alignment of the organization around measurable objectives and goals ● Identifying and measuring metrics that best suit these results ","362 ● Identifying the best tools to monitor compliance with objectives ● Improving the awareness and skills to identify gaps and trends ● Building the skills and systems to deploy course corrections ● Creating a feedback system that gives real-time information on course corrections across verticals in the Line of Sight implementation Final Words If you lead a business and prioritize employee engagement, line of sight management is one of the areas you should work on. You can start by communicating the organization’s vision, mission, strategy, goals, and business model to the employees and taking steps to ensure your teams know how their roles and efforts contribute to the achievement of goals. Consistency is the key to fostering a performance culture that will slowly drive the growth and success you aspire to. OBJECTIVES & KEY RESULTS (OKR) OKRs stand for objectives and key results, a goal-setting methodology that can help your team set and track measurable goals. Originally pioneered by John Doerr, this framework pairs the objectives you want to achieve with the key results you’ll use to measure progress—so your goals are tied to your team’s day-to-day work. In this article, we describe the OKR process and offer examples to get you started setting OKRs for your company, team, or personal life. If you regularly set team or company goals, you’ve likely heard the term OKRs thrown around. OKRs, or “objectives and key results,” are a goal setting methodology that can help teams set measurable goals. While most companies set goals, only 16% of knowledge workers say their company is effective at setting and communicating company goals. To increase employee engagement in goal setting and help your teams set and achieve ambitious goals, try setting OKRs. Components of an OKR OKRs follow a simple but immensely flexible template that bends and bows to fit nearly every purpose: I will [objective] as measured by [key result]. ","363 The Objective is the goal you want to achieve—increase brand awareness, create the lowest carbon footprint in your industry, that sort of thing. The Key Result is the metric by which you’ll measure your progress towards your objective—drive one million web visitors, ensure one-quarter of your product’s material is compostable, and so on. FAQ: What is the difference between OKRs and KPIs? KPIs, which stand for Key Performance Indicators, are a way for teams to track performance within projects and initiatives. OKRs, on the other hand, are a framework for setting and achieving goals. Because of the relationship between the objectives and key results, OKRs are a better way to holistically think about your goals and how they relate to your work. That isn’t to say your team can’t use KPIs. In fact, some KPIs make great KRs. Here’s how they differ, and how your team can benefit from both: KRs are the metrics by which you’ll measure the progress of your OKR. KRs can be quantitative (e.g. Increase web traffic to 2M users per month) or qualitative (e.g. Assess and document users’ pain points). In the latter example, “assess and document” can be measured in a number of ways: with polls, NPS surveys, direct feedback, etc. KPIs are quantifiable ways to measure your initiative against results. If you have an incredibly quantitative KR (e.g. Increase headcount by 15 people in Q3), you could use the KPI framework to support that initiative, as long as you connected the initiative to your company objectives. If both of these acronyms are new to you, stick to OKRs. By empowering your team with a holistic goal-setting framework, you can connect your individual work to your company’s big-picture goals to drive employee motivation and deliver better outcomes. Origins of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) When John Doerr joined Kleiner Perkins in 1980, he brought with him a radical new management methodology that would revolutionize Silicon Valley. He had spent the previous five years at Intel, where, while working under management guru Andy Grove, he learned about Grove’s revolutionary system for ","364 goal setting and accountability. “Andy had created this system for goal setting that was deceptively simple, but also the polar opposite of the conventional management by objectives (MBO) systems, which tend to be top-down, hierarchical, annual, and linked to compensation,” Doerr told Harvard Business Review. Grove’s new methodology worked on the revolutionary idea that teams perform better by focusing on outcomes—not procedure. Instead of telling Intel’s employees precisely what to do, Grove would set them a goal and let them work out how to achieve them. How to set good OKRs Because of how flexible the OKR framework is, you can set and phrase OKRs in a variety of ways. Like any goal, OKRs should be falsifiable and measurable. You should think of OKRs as the pillar of your strategy for the next period of time. However, to set good OKRs, you also need to connect them to your day-to-day work. Even though most companies set goals, research has shown that only 26% of employees have a clear understanding of how their individual work contributes towards company goals. That’s because most teams set goals at the beginning of a year or quarter, then never revisit them again. But, when employees have clarity on the relationship between their work and their company’s objectives, their motivation doubles. By connecting each individual’s work to your organization’s goals, your employees have the context for why their work matters. FAQ: How many OKRs should I set? There’s no set number for how many OKRs you should set, but in practice, aim to set no more than ten objectives. Each objective can have more than one supporting key result, depending on the team. Because your OKRs represent your big-picture goals, you want to set a number that you can reasonably complete in a set period of time, like a quarter or a year. You should also practice setting OKRs at both the company and team level. For example, if your company’s objective is to be the best-in-class solution in your field, your marketing team’s OKR might be to create a best-in-class product demo and share it with a certain number of people. ","365 Examples of team-specific OKRs When you step down a level, from the C-suite to functional teams, OKRs are equally effective. Just as they can direct our strategic thinking, they can guide our functional work, too. Here are a few team OKR examples. ● Marketing Objective: Increase brand awareness Key Result: Drive 1M web visitors Key Result: Increase social media following by 10x Key Result: Recruit and onboard 1,000 community members ● Examples of personal OKRs OKRs aren’t necessarily limited to the workplace, either. When asked about how he improved his personal life, John Doerr revealed he used his trusty system to maximize the time he spent with his family. Objective: Have more quality family time as measured by: Key Result: Getting home for dinner by 6 pm, 20 nights a month. Key Result: Being present by turning off the internet router to eliminate distractions. The benefits of OKRs So: should your team use OKRs? While there are various goal-setting methodologies your team can benefit from, OKRs help you align on flexible goals that are falsifiable, time-bound, and easily measurable. One of the biggest advantages to OKRs is you can map multiple KRs to each objective. That helps teams: ● Quickly set actionable goals OKRs have a built-in format that makes it easy for teams to get started on setting and refining their OKRs. If you’re new to OKRs, start with Andy Grove’s distilled methodology: I will [objective] as measured by [key result]. ","366 Instead of spending a lot of time thinking about how to phrase your goals, your team can now jump right into it. ● Easily set stretch goals To challenge yourself and your team, consider making at least one of your KRs a stretch goal. Stretch goals are deliberately challenging goals that you’re not 100% confident you can hit—and that’s ok! In fact, at Asana, we aim to hit about 70% of our goals. That tells us we’re setting challenging enough goals and helps us calibrate better goals for the next quarter. ● Boost cross-functional collaboration Oftentimes, your objectives will encompass initiatives from more than one department. Take the Allbirds example from earlier. Their objective is to Create the lowest carbon footprint in our industry. To do so, their product, shipping, operations, and design teams need to work together. These teams would likely have individual KRs contributing to that central objective. ● Increase employee engagement Because there can be several KRs to each objective, many companies choose to take a hybrid approach when it comes to setting OKRs: company leadership and executives set the objectives, and then individual teams or employees set the key results that contribute to those objectives. This hybrid top-down/bottom-up approach helps you include and engage your employees in the goal-setting process. Employees will understand exactly how their KR contributes to the company’s top-level objective, and that makes it easier for that KR to remain top of mind during the OKR cycle. ● Connect daily work to team and company objectives The biggest benefit of OKRs comes when you can connect your daily work to your team’s strategic objectives. OKRs already begin to do that by connecting the objective to the key results that contribute to it. To get the most out of OKRs, take that benefit a step further: use an OKR tool that connects your daily work and regular projects to your company and business goals. ","367 Execution is everything Thomas Edison once quipped that “vision without execution is hallucination. ” It’s an idea that deeply inspired Doerr and the OKR methodology: Good ideas with poor execution will forever remain just that, ideas. Doerr says the biggest lever in execution is goal setting—and by extension OKRs. It focuses our attention, establishes accountability, and highlights the activities that really drive progress. “When done right, goal setting is a very powerful tool,” Doerr told Betterworks. “Every team member in the company can link their goals to the corporate goals, knowing that their work is having a direct impact on the success of the company.” FINANCIAL MEASURES In Six Sigma projects, we use financial measures to analyze the wider effects of our efforts. Looking at the number of defects is ideal for identifying issues. However, it’s very low level and narrowly focused. It doesn’t help us measure the final impact of process changes. It also won’t mean much to stockholders and board members. That’s why we also need to use financial measures. There are two basic types of financial measures we can use: ● Forward looking measures: These help us figure out whether a project will be worthwhile. ● Backward looking measures: These help us to measure the financial effect of our recent projects. Returns This category of metrics look at the income received vs the effort made and the assets owned. They’re backward looking measures. In other words, they’re generally calculated after a project ends. ROI ","368 Return on Investment (ROI) = Gain realized / Effort spent. This metric measures how efficient and profitable an endeavor (project, program, etc) is. You could be building a valuable product, but spending too much money to get it. ROI = ((end value – cost) / cost) where: ● ROI = Return on Investment. ● End value = Final value of the project. ● Cost = the amount of money spent on the project. Example ROI calculation For example, a software company is creating a piece of software. It pays four developers and testers for a year to complete the product, at a cost of $250,000. It pays a marketer $50,000 for six months to create the marketing campaign. 300 customers subscribe to pay $200 a month for access to the software in the first year after the product is released. ROI = (end value – cost) / cost ROI = ((300 x 200 x 12) - 300000) / 300000 ROI = (720000 - 300000) / 300000 ROI = 420000 / 300000 ROI = 1.4 = 140% ROA Return on Assets (ROA) = Income / Assets. This metric measures how efficient management is in turning its holdings into earnings. It compares the company’s income with the assets it owns. Is it using those assets effectively to gain more income? ","369 ROA = (income / assets) Where: ROA = Return on assets. Income = The company’s net income. Assets = The current valuation of the company’s assets. Example ROA calculation The software company in the example above owns a server farm that delivers its software. Its current valuation is $200,000. So we plug that figure and its earnings into the ROA formula. ROA = income / assets ROA = 420000 / 200000 ROA = 2.1 = 210% Using ROI and ROA ROI and ROA are useful in Six Sigma because they help us gauge the success of completed projects. Cost-Benefit Analysis This is a forward looking measure. It involves looking at the projected costs and returns of a project. It gives us data that we need to decide whether a project is worth doing. But it’s not just useful within a team. You can use a cost benefit analysis to demonstrate the value of a project to people outside your team, like upper management. From a financial standpoint: ● If the cost is greater than the benefit, the project isn’t worthwhile. ● If the benefit is substantially greater than the cost, the project is worthwhile. How to conduct a cost-benefit analysis There are three basic steps to conducting a cost benefit analysis: 1. Calculate the expected costs of the project. Include one time costs like design ","370 and implementation resources, ongoing costs like training and new equipment, and cost of capital expenses. 2. Calculate the projected benefit of the project. This might include new one time revenue like customers buying a product, or ongoing benefits like reducing hours per week spent on specific tasks, at $/hr. 3. Determine the cost vs benefit ratio. Cost-Benefit Analysis formula CBA = (Cost / Benefit) Where: Cost = the projected cost of the project Benefit = the projected return of the project Example cost-benefit analysis calculation We can conduct a retrospective CBA on the software company that we looked at earlier. CBA = Cost / Benefit CBA = 300000 / 420000 CBA = 0.714 = 71.4% Net Present Value (NPV) Projects rarely deliver only simple, one time costs and returns. Often the costs and returns associated with a project will continue for years. The value of these costs and returns will change each year, thanks to inflation. One dollar today will be worth more than one dollar in five years’ time. We use NPV to calculate the present value of future costs and returns. Net Present Value formula NPV = Rt / (1 + i)t Where: ● NPV is the net present value. ","371 ● Rt is the net cash flow for the period. ● i is the discount rate: the return that could be made on an investment with a similar risk profile. ● t is the period of time. Internal Rate of Return (IRR) We can use the Internal Rate of Return for the cash flow each year to determine the projected percentage return from a project. The higher the IRR, the better. Generally, a company will compare the IRR to expected return from an investment with a similar risk profile. If the project’s IRR is a lot higher than the comparison investment return, it’s a winner. If it’s lower, then from a financial perspective, it doesn’t make sense to proceed. Note: Expected financial returns aren’t the only reason to go ahead with a project. There might be social or environmental returns that outweigh the financial aspect. However, most organizations will need to thoroughly understand the financial measures. IRR formula: 0 = P0 + P1/(1+IRR) + P2/(1+IRR)2 + P3/(1+IRR)3 + . . . +Pn/(1+IRR)n Where: P0 = the immediate cash flow (usually a negative figure). P1 = the projected cash flow in the first year. P2 = the projected cash flow in the second year. P3 = the projected cash flow in the third year. Pn = the projected cash flow in the nth year. IRR = the Internal Rate of Return. This is pretty complicated to solve manually, but Excel has inbuilt IRR formulas that you can utilize. Example IRR scenario ","372 A company is considering moving its software product into the cloud. It’s calculated that the initial cost would be around $50,000, and annual maintenance and upgrade costs would be about $10,000 thereafter. But it’s also figured that it would no longer need to maintain a bank of servers to host the development and production environments (a saving of around $100,000 over five years) and would save around $5000 a year currently being offered in discounts to customers when server outages occur. Its IRR equation would look something like this: 0 = -50000 + 15000/(1+IRR) + 15000/(1+IRR)2 + 15000/(1+IRR)3 + 15000/(1+IRR)4 + 15000/(1+IRR)5 In Excel, we’d add the key data: A B 1 Year Cash flow 2 0 -50000 3 1 15000 4 2 15000 5 3 15000 6 4 15000 7 5 15000 Then we’d use the following Excel formula to calculate the IRR: =IRR(B2:B7) Which Excel calculates as 15%. A fair investment return for 5 years is 10%. So a 15% projected return gives extra value, and will probably be accepted as a worthwhile venture. Payback Period ","373 Payback is one of the useful capital budgeting methods. It is generally used to evaluate the project considering the associated risks before investing. Payback calculates the number of years after the initial investment amount will be recovered from a project’s net cash inflows. In other words, the length of the time initial outlay of investment reaches a break even point. Invest in a project where payback is less than the maximum allowed time. Payback period formula The formula for payback period depends on fixed and irregular cash flow. Case1: Fixed cash inflow: Payback period = Initial investment/Net cash inflows per period Case 2: Irregular cash inflow: Payback period = Last time period with negative net cash flow (Net cash flow at the time of last negative value/ cash flow of the consecutive year) Payback period example Example1: Fixed or even cash flow Method: A manufacturing plant is planning to start a new project with an initial investment of $115 million. Management expecting returns of $20 million per year in net cash flows for 8 years. Calculate the payback period of the new project. Initial investment = $115 million Cash flow per year = $20 million Number of years = 8 Payback period = Initial investment / Net cash flow per period = $115/$20 = 5.75 years. Example 2 : Irregular or uneven cash flow method: A manufacturing plant is planning to start a new project with an initial investment of $80 million. Management expects returns of $15 million in the first year, $ 20 million in the second year, $25 million third year and $35million in the fourth year, and $20 million in the fifth year. Calculate the payback period. Payback period =Last time period with negative net cash flow (Net cash flow at the ","374 time of last negative value/ cash flow of the consecutive year) = 3+(20/35) = 3+0.57=3.57 years Advantages of Payback period ● Payback method is very easy to understand and calculate the period ● It considers the organization liquidity, helps to find the project that provides quick returns ● Favors with ranking and accounts the inherent project risks Disadvantages of Payback period ● Payback does not consider the time value of money ● It does not account for the cash flows after the payback period ","375 CHAPTER 6: TEAM MANAGEMENT ","376 Teams can be divided into four main groups: project teams, self-managed teams, virtual teams, and operational teams. What type of team you have depends on its purpose, location, and organizational structure. Each type of team comes with its unique set of strengths and weaknesses. In order to fully utilize your team, you first need to understand where each type of team works the best. Project Teams Project teams are groups of employees who work collectively toward shared goals. This type of team allows you to structure work in a specific, measurable, and time- constrained way. You can assign clear roles, responsibilities, and deadlines. Also, by selecting both experienced and inexperienced workers, you enable them to do informal coaching and mentoring. There are four main types of project teams: Functional Teams These teams are permanent and always include members of the same department with different responsibilities. A manager is responsible for everything, and everyone reports to him. These types of teams are more likely to be found in companies that incorporate traditional project management. Sometimes, in order to complete a project, several departments need to work together. For example: ● Work on the new product starts with the idea from the marketing department; ● The idea is passed down to research and development to determine its feasibility; ● After R&D, the design department is tasked with giving it an appealing look ","377 and feel; ● And finally, the product is made by the manufacturing department. This type of approach is known as ‘baton passing’. It requires a manager that has oversight of the entire project and ensures that there are no obstacles when it comes to transferring work from one team to another. Advantages and Disadvantages of Functional Teams Advantages: ● Handles routine work ● Line management has control of projects ● Pools technical and professional expertise Disadvantages: ● Difficult communication across areas ● Pushing the decision-making process upwards ● Inflexible Cross-functional Teams Cross-functional teams are made up of members from various departments. These teams tackle specific tasks that require different inputs and expertise. Even though cross-functional teams are becoming increasingly popular worldwide, a recent study has proven that a whopping 75% of all cross-functional teams are dysfunctional. Advantages and Disadvantages of Cross-functional Teams Advantages: ","378 ● Greater speed of task completion ● Can handle a wide array of projects ● Source of unconventional ideas Disadvantages: ● Takes a long time to develop cohesion ● Management can prove to be challenging ● Diversity can cause conflict Matrix Teams These teams are characterized by a “two-boss system”, where an individual reports to a different manager for various aspects of his work. This type of team is the product of the Matrix management approach. Let’s say Jeff, a designer, was given the task of making a design for a new product that marketing provided an idea for and that R&D deemed feasible. By being included in this project, Jeff all of a sudden has two bosses: the first one is a project manager who only cares about the design being done, while the other one is his functional line manager who’s in charge of Jeff’s training, career development, and routine tasks. While this approach helps the top management retain control over the project without being included in day-to-day decisions, employees are often faced with challenges of dual command: Jeff now has to report to two managers, who might give him conflicting instructions, which causes confusion and frustration. Advantages and Disadvantages of Matrix Teams ","379 Advantages: ● Acceptable to traditional managers ● Flexibility for assigned personnel ● Top management controls projects, stays out of daily activities Disadvantages: ● Dual reporting ● The team leader is usually unable to choose who will be on the project ● Difficult performance appraisal Contract Teams Contract teams are outsourced teams that are tied down by a contract and brought in to complete a part of a project. After the project is completed and the contract has ended, the client can cut all ties to the team, no questions asked. The project manager is the key to success when it comes to contract teams. The project manager has to: ● maintain constant communication between the team and the client, ● compensate for the lack of a team’s physical presence (given that most contract teams work remotely), ● and bear full responsibility for the success or failure of a project Advantages and Disadvantages of Contract Teams Advantages: ● Easy employment of experts ● A team can use the existing management structure ● No need for client training Disadvantages: ","380 ● Difficult assessment of project progress for the client ● Difficult to resolve political and organizational issues ● The client is the only judge of success Self-managed Teams Typically, members of self-managed teams are employees of the same organization who work together, and even though they have a wide array of objectives, their aim is to reach a common goal. There is no manager nor authority figure, so it is up to members to determine rules and expectations, to solve problems when they arise, and to carry shared responsibility for the results. One of the first major companies that decided to implement self-managed teams was software company Valve in 2012. Around 300 employees have neither bosses nor a formal division of labor. Instead, they are expected to organize themselves around individual or group projects and are obligated to take care of customer support themselves. The work ethic at Valve relied heavily on individual responsibility. When setting up a self-managed team, you have to define two parameters: ● Levels of responsibility ● The autonomy that is given to the self-managed team Research has shown that employees in self-managed teams feel more useful on the job and find their jobs more challenging, although there is no proof that they are actually more productive. Advantages and Disadvantages of Self-Managed Teams Advantages: ● Autonomy improves employee motivation; ● Team members can manage their own time and handle tasks when it suits them; ","381 ● You don’t have to pay for an office; ● Shared responsibility instills pride in team accomplishments. Disadvantages: ● The lack of hierarchical authority can put personal relationships over good judgment; ● It can lead to conformity that suppresses creativity and critical thinking; ● An added layer of responsibility is time-consuming and requires skills that some people simply don’t have; ● Training time and costs are higher due to a broader scope of duties. Virtual (Remote) Teams Virtual teams are made up of people who work in different physical locations and who rely heavily on collaboration tools to get things done together. Virtual teams provide members with a better life-work balance and allow business owners to employ the best experts in the field, regardless of the fact that they live on another continent. One of the organizations that had the most success with its virtual teams is Automattic, best known by their company, WordPress. Over 100 employees in 43 different countries use WordPress plugin P2 which enables them to communicate with each other in real-time. Also, when a new employee gets on board he receives a $2.000 stipend to improve his home office, gets the latest Macbook, and an open “time off” policy to use to take free time whenever they need. It may seem a little far-fetched, but this policy is one of the key factors behind Automatic’s success: WordPress is now used by 40% of websites globally. “Remote employee monitoring is so different from monitoring staff in an office environment. It demands huge trust, as well as having efficient communication channels set up. You have to learn to read a person's emotions and level of confidence without being able to see their face – which is hard” — Cam Lee, Rock Agency ","382 Types of virtual teams According to the Manager’s guide to virtual teams, virtual teams are characterized by three dimensions: Time - WHEN people work. They could work during different hours, on different shifts, or in different time zones. Space - WHERE people work. They could be working right next to each other or hundreds of miles away. Culture - HOW and WHOM people work for. ‘Culture’ dimension includes factors such as gender, race, language, profession, education, nationality, as well as political, social, religious, and economic factors. Operational teams support other types of teams. They are formed to make sure that all back-office processes go smoothly. For example, the Human Resource department doesn’t handle any projects but it has to perform candidate screening, interviewing, and recruiting. If one of the key players decides to leave, HR has to find a substitute so the respective team can carry on its work. Also, operational teams can have their own projects and function like a project team because they have well-defined roles and responsibilities. For instance, if the accounting department received a task to make an annual financial report by a certain date, they will most likely devise a timeline, delegate tasks, and keep track of deadlines just like any other project team. What type of team is right for you? When choosing a type of team to perform a certain task, ask yourself these ","383 questions: ● What’s the team’s purpose exactly? ● How many people are required, and what will their roles be? ● Are selected members capable of self-management, or do they require a strong leader? ● Is it necessary for them to be located in a single place? ● Is their engagement temporary or permanent? If you have a project that requires input from marketing, design as well as the Customer Support department, choose a cross-functional team. \"An effective team would demonstrate: The willingness to teach one another, Clear communication, High morale to maintain inspiration, Fill in gaps for one another (skill, time, circumstance), Strong as an individual, unstoppable as a group.\" — Kalila Lakeworth, DigiSomni If, on the other hand, you choose to outsource the design, and the agency you have chosen uses a designer that works remotely, the only logical way to go is opting for a mixture of virtual and contract teams. In practice, you will rarely find a team that can be defined as solely functional or solely virtual: most teams in modern business represent a hybrid of some, if not all of the team types. Effectively Define Team Roles and Responsibilities: Clearly defining team roles and responsibilities encourages you and your team to work towards goals much more efficiently. Too much ambiguity about team roles and responsibilities in the workplace can cause a lot of confusion and stump productivity. In contrast, knowing exactly what is expected of you, allows for more effective and productive work. In order for your team members to understand what is expected of them, it is crucial that you take some time in defining roles distinctly. This is going to steer you in the direction of team success, and team satisfaction, and you’ll see your goals and objectives being met a lot more effectively. ","384 Because defining team member roles is so important, Fellow has put together all there is to know about clearly setting out roles and specific responsibilities for each team member. Keep scrolling if you want to boost your team’s engagement and productivity! ● What are team roles and responsibilities? ● Why take time to clarify team roles? ● Benefits of defining team roles and responsibilities ● 6 Tips to Define Team Roles and Responsibilities What are team roles and responsibilities? Team roles and responsibilities refer to the tasks associated with a person’s job description, and therefore their role within the organization. Because each team member holds several different duties and is responsible for completing a similar theme of tasks each day, it’s really important that responsibilities are clearly defined. In fact, the more clearly defined, the less confusion and the more time that can actually be spent working towards organizational goals and objectives. The more that individuals understand what is required of them, the more that they achieve and the more motivated they feel to achieve these goals. A team leader or project manager needs to understand each individual’s role at the company so that they can set realistic expectations, set team goals and effectively delegate responsibilities. Why take time to clarify team roles? Taking the time to clarify roles and responsibilities is only going to create a more effective work synergy, hold each team member accountable and eliminate confusion. When everyone understands what is expected of them, it promotes more autonomy and allows people to use their time much more effectively, without needing to stop and clarify at every step. What’s better is that, if you clearly understand the roles and responsibilities of each member of the team, it provides the opportunity for every other team member to also understand what their co-workers are working on. This way, your team can collaborate and come together to get expert opinions and support from their ","385 colleagues. Benefits of defining team roles and responsibilities The most significant benefit of defining team roles and responsibilities is eliminating confusion. This clarifies what is specifically expected of each team member and holds them accountable for their responsibilities. If everyone clearly understands what they should be working towards, their time is going to be utilized much more effectively and in turn, this makes your team more productive. The result? Team success. Like we said before, it’s important that your team members know what their colleagues are working on so that they can lend a hand or ask for support with their own responsibilities. Understanding their own and their colleagues’ responsibilities completely eliminates any opportunity for micro-management, because you have given them all of the information that they need in order to work both independently or collaboratively. 6 Tips to Define Team Roles and Responsibilities Now that we’ve taken a look at what team roles and responsibilities are, why it’s valuable to take the time to clarify them, and discussed the benefits, we’re going to give you a few tips to specifically define roles and responsibilities in the workplace. 1. Understand your team’s strengths 2. Determine what needs to get done 3. Meet to discuss priorities on an ongoing basis 4. Give people ownership over specific areas 5. Ask employees about their long-term goals 6. Align roles and responsibilities with their goals ‘Ability to Work in a Team Environment’ Truly Mean? While it may seem self-explanatory, the selection panel is looking for some things in ","386 particular for this key selection criteria. Mainly, they want to see that you have the appropriate skills which make you a team player. These include: ● customer service skills ● organizational skills ● analytical skills ● decision-making skills ● communication skills ● time management skills ● interpersonal skills ● problem-solving skills ● leadership skills ● teamwork skills Team Member Selection Criteria Most selection criteria include team player skills or working as part of a team. A search for useful material reveals a distinction is drawn between what makes for an effective team and what makes for an effective team player. The lines between the two can blur, however an effective team is usually characterized by: ● Having clear goals that are understood by all members. ● Roles and responsibilities are clearly understood. ● Everyone is committed to the results and deadlines of the team. ● Competent members of the team. ● A collaborative climate. ● Conflict and dissent are dealt with. Patrick Lencioni’s book The Ideal Team Player presents a simple model of three virtues that he considers indispensable in team players. Ideal team players, according to this model, are: Humble. ‘They lack excessive ego or concerns about status. Humble people are quick to point out the contributions of others and slow to seek attention for their own. They share credit, emphasize team over self and define success collectively rather than individually.’ Hungry. ‘They are always looking for more. More things to do. More to learn. More ","387 responsibility to take on. Hungry people almost never have to be pushed by a manager to work harder because they are self-motivated and diligent. They are constantly thinking about the next step and the next opportunity.’ Smart. ‘They have common sense about people. Smart people tend to know what is happening in a group situation and how to deal with others in the most effective way. They have good judgment and intuition around the subtleties of group dynamics and the impact of their words and actions.’ This model encompasses most of the above long list of qualities and deals with what makes teams dysfunctional. Lencioni identifies five main team dysfunctions: ● ‘Inattention to Results ● Avoidance of Accountability ● Lack of Commitment ● Fear of Conflict ● Absence of Trust’ A humble, hungry, smart team member avoids these dysfunctions because they: ● ‘Share accomplishments with everyone and leave their egos at the door. ● Hold their colleagues accountable, always strive to learn and do more and constantly look toward the next opportunity. ● Commit to team goals and do whatever is necessary to accomplish objectives. ● Do and say the right things to help teammates feel appreciated and understood, even when difficult situations arise. ● Build trusting relationships by being open and accessible.’ FACTORS FOR TEAM EFFECTIVENESS Team effectiveness has always been a big part of any company and its success. But as more companies adopt hybrid and remote work structures, leaders need to amp up their team management skills. Everyone has emotional needs at work, but remote workers have some unique challenges. They struggle with feelings of loneliness and isolation, difficulties communicating and collaborating, and distractions. Without solid leadership, these challenges hurt team effectiveness, ranging from lack of productivity to burnout. ","388 So how can we ensure team effectiveness as we continue working remotely? There are six team effectiveness factors that contribute to keeping your employees engaged and focused: 1. Reinforce a shared purpose As the pandemic forced businesses to work remotely, leaders became laser-focused on strategy and keeping the business running. But since the change, leaders must work to inspire their teams with a sense of purpose and vision. After a huge disruption, like the pandemic, teams need to know their company has a new vision. Leaders must lay out the new direction and provide updates for their teams. They need a true north for their teams to rally, and align, around. Leaders also need to show their team how changes impact their individual goals and purpose. And most importantly? Leaders need to show their teams that they value their efforts. Simply put, employees need to know why they’re doing something, and how and why it makes a difference. Everyone should know if their team goals are aligned with their company, overall. In addition, teams should also understand why their team even exists, and its business impact. This sense of purpose isn’t just to make people feel good. It has huge bottom-line implications. The Global Leadership Forecast 2018 found that purpose-driven companies outperform others by 42 percent. 2. Provide role clarity Everything changed during the pandemic – not just where we work, but also how we work. This means some people saw their roles change to meet the company’s needs. When responsibilities shift, sometimes that can cause confusion among teams, so leaders need to communicate their roles. In a remote working environment, everyone needs to be clear on who does what. This is especially important with long-term remote working – so employees can remain focused on achieving goals, and leaders don’t need to micromanage. Leaders establish this by setting individual goals, and responsibilities and making sure expected contributions are clear. More importantly, leaders should make sure each team member’s qualifications, capabilities, and motivation match the role. Also, ","389 team members should help leaders by knowing their own boundaries when making decisions and assigning work. 3. Promote enabling processes Teams to know their objectives. But do they have the means to accomplish those objectives? Leaders can’t let this area slip, especially when working remotely. An effective team shares progress and gathers feedback, which is even more important while working remotely. Teams need time to reflect on their successes and failures. They also need to ensure they have the time, staff, funding, and resources to do their job. Teams are most effective with clear processes of how to plan, track, document and manage work. When working remotely, it’s sometimes difficult to manage time. With 71 percent of managers calling meetings unproductive and inefficient, it’s easy to see how some teams may get frustrated with meetings. Leaders need to make sure their teams are not falling behind because of wasted time. Leaders should host regular check-ins with their teams to get feedback on whether they have what they need. 4. Be aware of emotional security Team members want to feel comfortable, valued and involved. Unfortunately, the vast majority don’t feel this way. Only 31 percent of employees say their leaders promote an inclusive team environment. This leads to a lack of emotional security. Teams establish emotional security with a high level of trust, comfort, and understanding. They also need to respect one another, and intentionally invite everyone’s input and incorporate it into collective activities, like brainstorming sessions. Simple things like using video during conferencing help to encourage participation and allow a team leader to look for non-verbal cues around engagement and inclusion. Emotional security is one of the most important factors in teams, especially during times of crisis and uncertainty. Leaders need to engage with their teams emotionally to keep them engaged and productive. 5. Encourage a collaborative spirit ","390 There’s a reason we work in teams – we need each other to accomplish our goals. A collaborative spirit encourages everyone to come together to think about the best ways to tackle work. It often brings new, diverse ideas and perspectives to the team. But even before the pandemic, team collaboration might not have been happening. The Frontline Leader Project found that 52 percent of leaders say their teams work in silos instead of working collaboratively. This creates problems outside of individual teams. For example, one department may not know what the other is doing, or workstreams could overlap. A lack of collaboration impacts everyone differently. But for remote workers already feeling isolated could make them feel even more alienated. That’s why leaders must encourage a collaborative spirit if they hope to have team effectiveness. Instead, they should be sharing relevant information openly and clearly in a team scenario. Also, leaders should encourage their team to prioritize collective contributions over the individual competition. 6. Growth orientation People need to learn and grow if they want to improve their performance. But we’re not talking about additional training courses. Instead, we’re talking about good old- fashioned teamwork and collaboration. One way to continue growing is for team members to learn from each other. Teams provide opportunities for everyone to grow and develop skills together. Usually, more effective teams provide more ideas and output to benefit the entire organization, sparking growth. These ideas come from experimenting or brainstorming new ways to solve problems. Leaders should encourage and provide these opportunities. This is one of the best ways to find innovative approaches to complete work while keeping your team engaged. These challenges help teams learn and grow. It’s also important for leaders to know when to just listen. Sometimes allowing the team to lead and coach their leader provides invaluable insights. In the current landscape, people may feel trapped by working from home and having to remain distant from others. The same poll from earlier found that 16.4 ","391 percent found there were not a lot of opportunities to learn or grow. Teamwork matters So we’ve established that teams have both practical and personal needs, all of which affect team effectiveness. The first three factors address the practical side of teams. They need to understand their purpose, roles, and processes. The last three factors address their personal needs. They need to feel safe and valued, work well together, and be challenged to learn and grow. What happens when you drop those team needs? Chances are, you won’t succeed. Both practical and personal needs balance each other out. Good leaders engage their team’s heads and hearts. Team Motivation Lean production process can only be achieved if the performance of the workers involved is at its highest level. Lean managers, however, must not forget that organizational performance always comes down to the behavior of the workers, which is always determined by competence and motivation. Workers must possess competence in both technical and social skills. We cannot expect a highly competent technical person to achieve great results if he does not know how to deal with fellow workers. All his talents will be wasted once animosity in the workplace starts to rear its ugly head. Therefore, Lean managers are also tasked to motivate their employees in order for them to internalize the organizational goals and the individual goals of each work unit. The job of management requires optimizing all of the available sources of motivation to encourage those behaviors that contribute to the success of your business organization. The following 7 techniques are used by Lean managers to build a motivational culture in the organization. After you’ve read them all, you will be able to answer that question: Is Al Pacino a Lean Coach? 1. Recognition of individual ability It is basic human nature that an individual needs personal recognition. This recognition is over and above the recognition that management might bestow on a ","392 group of workers working as a team. While group recognition is also important, as it will boost the morale of a team, an individual, personal recognition will have a great impact on the worker who was singled out for his great individual performance. This will encourage him to be a better contributor to his group, and to the organization as a whole. 2. Sense of achievement Management must create among workers the feeling that they achieve something, both individually and collectively. Recognition must be given for both individual and group achievement. Management must make sure that workers feel that sense of achievement whenever a goal has been reached or when new innovations have been affected. Show team achievements during stand-ups meeting in the morning. 3. Learning and growth Learning and growing within an organization is a continuous process. It does not end when a worker has mastered the necessary skills for his job. Management must give workers opportunities to learn new skills to enable them to move to a different level, possibly a higher one, within the organization. Further education and training opportunities must be made available to workers who have the ambition to grow in the organizational hierarchy. Try to organize small training sessions where people share field experience and tips. 4. Stimulating work Management must create a work environment that will be stimulating to the workers. Continuous improvement culture must stimulate workers to solve small problems, spot waste, collaborate, and feel responsible for all the achievements of the organization and for the clients. 5. Responsibility and empowerment Workers are given their individual and collective responsibilities as individual workers and as a member of the team. Together with the responsibility given comes the empowerment of the same. Workers must be empowered, or given the authority, to carry out their responsibilities. ","393 6. Promotion A higher position with the corresponding higher pay is one of the greatest motivators for the workers. When a worker who has achieved so much, as an individual worker and as a member of a team, is given a higher position in the organization, coupled with the corresponding salary raise, he will be encouraged even more to put his best in whatever he does in the organization. 7. Feeling of being part of something A worker must never feel that is just one of the many nameless and faceless workers in the organization. He must be given recognition as a contributor to the achievements of the organization. Every single worker must feel that he is part of something important in the organization. He must feel that he is an important cog in the organizational machine. A highly motivated work environment is not an accident. It is always the result of systematic and concerted efforts of management to improve and create a system of motivators. It is a holistic approach to motivate workers. So, is Al Pacino a Lean Coach? WAYS TO MOTIVATE TEAMMATES People are the main and the most important resource of each company. For achieving great results each leader needs to have a motivation strategy to create and maintain the spirit of enthusiasm among employees. Below are 15 effective ways for you to motivate your staff and ensure the continuous growth of your organization. 1. Share the Organizational Vision With Each Member If everyone is aware of the collective vision, which will lead to the prosperity and success of each team member, motivation and enthusiasm become the indivisible parts of all activities. Make sure that you continuously concentrate the attention of your staff on the glory of reaching that powerful vision. 2. Communicate With Your Staff ","394 You can't learn about ideas, attitude or concerns of your team members without constant communication. Use each opportunity to interact with them and you will discover hundreds of new ways of organizing your activities more successfully. 3. Make People Feel Appreciated One of the greatest needs of each person is the need to be appreciated. Very often appreciation is a greater reward than money. Show your sincere gratitude for the unique contribution every one makes to the organization. 4. Support New Ideas Each team member will feel empowered by the opportunity to not only implement day to day tasks, but as well as suggest new ideas and make them a reality. Give people a chance to take initiative and you will be amazed by their ability to create brilliant ideas. 5. Give Challenging Tasks People can't grow if they are constantly doing what they have always done. Let them develop new skills by giving challenging tasks. At the same time make sure the tasks are reachable and in the frames of the person's interests. 6. Encourage Creativity Supervising doesn't mean controlling each and every step. It means making sure that all the organizational activities are being implemented at the highest level. Give people the freedom to find their own unique ways of solving issues. Challenge them to think out of the box. 7. Give Each One Opportunities to Grow If people know that everything is going to be the same way all the time, they will definitely lose the motivation to put their maximum efforts in work. They should be sure that their devotion and hard work will lead to new personal and professional achievements. 8. Empower Each Individual Very often people need just a little encouragement to believe in themselves and to realize that they have a greater potential within. Always show your confidence in the unique abilities and potential of your team members. ","395 9. Give as Much Support as You Can Even if people in your organization are self-disciplined and creative enough for finding solutions to various problems, they are always in need of your guidance. Support them as much as you can, and they will be inspired to do the same for you and for the organization. 10. Manage Each One Individually Every person has their strengths and weaknesses. Someone may be amazing at public speaking, while the other one has great writing skills. Give people a chance to operate in the frames of their strengths, and they will be more confident and motivated in their activities. 11. Don't Let Your People Become Bored Do you want your team to be enthusiastic and productive? Then avoid routine. Routine is the enthusiasm killer. Let people explore and discover. Make the work as interesting and engaging as you can. 12. Create Healthy Competition For this purpose you can effectively use the famous reward system. People contribute their efforts and ideas to the maximum when they know that outstanding excellence will lead to rewards. Just make sure that the reward system is absolutely transparent to everyone. 13. Celebrate Each Success Even the smallest achievements are worth being celebrated. The road to success consists of a thousand small steps. Glorify each and every goal achieved. Show to your team that all of you made one more important step forward. 14. Make Sure There is a Good Working Environment Research showed that the environment is more important to employees than money. This is a great chance for you to create extra motivation for your staff by making the work environment a beautiful place to work, rest, and have fun at the same time. ","396 15. Create and Maintain a Team Spirit Team is like a family, where mutual support and trust are the most important values. Organize team activities both during working time and after. You will have the half of success by creating and maintaining a powerful team spirit at the workplace CLASSIC STAGES OF TEAM DEVELOPMENT Teams move through a series of stages, beginning when they are formed and ending when they are disbanded. Bruce Tuckman identified four distinct phases of team development: forming, storming, norming, and performing. Each has a primary purpose and a common set of interpersonal dynamics among team members. Tuckman proposed that all are inevitable and even necessary parts of a successful team's evolution. Four stages of team building: ● Forming. The characteristics of the forming stage: knowledge is hidden, trust unknown. ● Storming. The characteristics of the storming stage: distrust, knowledge hoarding. ● Norming. The characteristics of the norming stage: collaboration, and knowledge sharing. ● Performing. The characteristics of the performing stage: synergize, and knowledge creation. ","397 Stages of Team The Forming Stage The first step in a team's life is bringing together a group of individuals. Individuals focus on defining and assigning tasks, establishing a schedule, organizing the team's work, and other startup matters. In addition to focusing on the scope of the team's purpose and how to approach it, individuals in the formation stage are also gathering information and impressions about each other. Since people generally want to be accepted by others, during this period they usually avoid conflict and disagreement. Team members may begin to work on their tasks independently, not yet focused on their relationships with fellow team members. The Storming Stage Once their efforts are underway, team members need clarity about their activities and goals, as well as explicit guidance about how they will work independently and collectively. This leads to a period known as storming—because it can involve brainstorming ideas and also because it usually causes disruption. During the storming, stage members begin to share ideas about what to do and how to do it that compete for consideration. Team members start to open up to each other and ","398 confront one another's ideas and perspectives. Because storming can be contentious, members who are averse to the conflict will find it unpleasant or even painful. This can decrease motivation and effort by drawing attention away from tasks. In some cases storming (i.e., disagreements) can be resolved quickly. Other times a team never leaves this stage and becomes stuck and unable to do its work. Patience and consideration toward team members and their views go a long way toward avoiding this. The Norming Stage Successfully moving through the storming stage means that a team has clarified its purpose and strategy for achieving its goals. It now transitions to a period focused on developing shared values about how team members will work together. These norms of collaboration can address issues ranging from when to use certain modes of communication, such as e-mail versus telephone, to how team meetings will be run and what to do when conflicts arise. Norms become a way of simplifying choices and facilitating collaboration since members have shared expectations about how work will get done. The Performing Stage Once norms are established and the team is functioning as a unit, it enters the performing stage. By now team members work together easily on interdependent tasks and can communicate and coordinate effectively. There are fewer time- consuming distractions based on interpersonal and group dynamics. For this reason, motivation is usually high and team members have confidence in their ability to attain goals. While these four stages—forming, storming, norming, and performing—are distinct and generally sequential, they often blend into one another and even overlap. A team may pass through one phase only to return to it. For example, if a new member joins the team there may be a second brief period of the formation while that person is integrated. A team may also need to return to an earlier stage if its performance declines. Team-building exercises are often done to help a team through its development process. ","399 KEY TAKEAWAYS ● Teams move through a series of four phases—from when they are formed to when their work is complete. ● During the forming stage, a team discusses its purpose, defines and assigns tasks, establishes timelines, and begins forming personal relationships. ● The often-contentious storming stage is the period when team members clarify their goals and the strategy for achieving them. ● The norming stage is when the team establishes its values for how individuals will interact and collaborate. ● Performing is the stage of team development when team members have productive relationships and are able to communicate and coordinate effectively and efficiently. ● While teams move through the four stages in sequence, the phases may overlap or be repeated. LEADERSHIP APPROACHES Throughout history, great leaders have emerged with particular leadership styles in providing direction, implementing plans, and motivating people. These can be broadly grouped into 5 different categories: ● Authoritarian Leadership ● Participative Leadership ● Delegative Leadership ● Transactional Leadership ● Transformational Leadership Despite these definitions, questions still remain. ● What is the meaning of each leadership style mentioned above? ● What is the difference between the different leadership approaches? ● What are the advantages and disadvantages of using each of the leadership styles? ","400 1. Authoritarian Leadership Authoritarian leadership styles allow a leader to impose expectations and define outcomes. A one-person show can turn out to be successful in situations when a leader is the most knowledgeable in the team. Although this is an efficient strategy in time-constrained periods, creativity will be sacrificed since input from the team is limited. The authoritarian leadership style is also used when team members need clear guidelines. Advantages: ● Time spent on making crucial decisions can be reduced. ● The chain of command can be clearly emphasized. ● Mistakes in the implementation of plans can be reduced. ● Using an authoritarian leadership style creates consistent results. Disadvantages: ● A very strict leadership style can sometimes lead to employee rebellion. ● It kills employee creativity and innovation. ● It reduces group synergy & collaboration. Group input is reduced dramatically. Authoritarian leadership increases the employee turnover rate. 2. Participative Leadership Participative leadership styles are rooted in democratic theory. The essence is to involve team members in the decision-making process. Team members thus feel included, engaged, and motivated to contribute. The leader will normally have the last word in the decision-making process. However, if there are disagreements within a group, it can be a time-consuming process to reach a consensus. Advantages: ● It increases employee motivation and job satisfaction. ● It encourages the use of employee creativity. ● A participative leadership style helps in the creation of a strong team. ● A high level of productivity can be achieved. ","401 Disadvantages: ● Decision-making processes become time-consuming. ● Leaders have a high probability of being apologetic to employees. ● Communication failures can sometimes happen. ● Security issues can arise because of transparency in information sharing. ● Poor decisions can be made if the employees are unskilled. 3. Delegative leadership Also known as \"laissez-faire leadership\", a delegative leadership style focuses on delegating initiative to team members. This can be a successful strategy if team members are competent, take responsibility, and prefer engaging in individual work. However, disagreements among the members may split and divide a group, leading to poor motivation and low morale. Advantages: ● Experienced employees can take advantage of their competence and experience. ● Innovation & creativity is highly valued. ● Delegative leadership creates a positive work environment. Disadvantages: ● Command responsibility is not properly defined. ● Delegative leadership creates difficulty in adapting to change. 4. Transactional leadership Transactional leadership styles use \"transactions\" between a leader and his or her followers - rewards, punishments, and other exchanges - to get the job done. The leader sets clear goals, and team members know how they'll be rewarded for their compliance. This \"give and take\" leadership style is more concerned with following established routines and procedures in an efficient manner, than with making any transformational changes to an organization. Advantages: ","402 ● Leaders create specific, measurable, and time-bound goals that are achievable for employees. ● Employee motivation and productivity is increased. ● Transactional leadership eliminates or minimizes confusion in the chain of command. ● It creates a system that is easy to implement for leaders and easy to follow by employees. ● Employees can choose reward systems. Disadvantages: ● Innovation & creativity are minimized. ● Empathy is not valued. ● Transactional leadership creates more followers than leaders among employees. 5. Transformational Leadership In transformational leadership styles, the leader inspires his or her followers with a vision and then encourages and empowers them to achieve it. The leader also serves as a role model for the vision. Advantages: ● It leads to a lower employee turnover rate. ● Transformational leadership places high value on corporate vision. ● High morale of employees is often experienced. ● It uses motivation and inspiration to gain the support of employees. ● It is not a coercive approach to leadership. ● It places high value on relationships. Disadvantages: ● Leaders can deceive employees. ● Consistent motivation and constant feedback may be required. ● Tasks can’t be pushed through without the agreement of employees. ● Transformational leadership can sometimes lead to the deviation of protocols and regulations. ","403 CONFLICT RESOLUTION TECHNIQUES Today we will discuss the five conflict resolution techniques that we use in project management to resolve conflict.These techniques are universal to any type of workplace. However, in project management, the work environment is dynamic and stressful, unlike the functional environment. Conflicts are common occurrences. If you are managing projects, you know how important it is to manage conflicts, and that is why you should understand the conflict resolution techniques. When two or more stakeholders have different opinions or interests, conflict can occur. Schedule priorities, scarce resources, technical reasons, and personal issues can all cause clashes. According to the American Management Association, managers spend 24% of their time managing conflicts. Don’t panic; the situation is usually not as bad as you think. Resolving conflicts appropriately can build trust and sometimes bring new ideas and opportunities. This can make the difference between a positive and negative outcome. If you don’t solve the conflict, your team members will lose trust. It will weaken your position as a project manager and the ability of your team to bond, which may affect your project’s success. You must deal with conflict before it is beyond resolution. The following are a few consequences of improper conflict management: ● Low team morale ● Negative impact on the project manager’s authority ● Increased number of personal clashes ● Low productivity and efficiency ● Low-quality work If required, project managers must monitor and resolve conflicts as quickly as possible to keep them from becoming bigger issues. Now, we will talk about conflict resolution techniques. Here are the five techniques, according to PMI: ","404 ● Withdraw/Avoid ● Smooth/Accommodate ● Compromise/Reconcile ● Force/Direct ● Collaborate/Problem Solve These conflict management strategies are also known as Thomas-Kilmann’s five approaches to resolving conflict. Let’s discuss each technique in detail. 1. Withdraw or Avoid In this conflict resolution technique, you avoid the conflict or retreat and allow the conflict to resolve itself. This is for when stakes are low, and the conflict is likely to disappear on its own. Use this technique in the following cases: ● Individuals involved in the conflict are not influential stakeholders. ● The issue does not require a time investment. ● An intense argument has already happened, and the individuals need time to cool off. ● You do not have enough information to pursue other techniques. Advantages This technique saves time that you can invest elsewhere. It is a good conflict management strategy to apply to low-level disagreements and gives you enough time to prepare if the conflict re-emerges. Disadvantages Withdrawing or avoiding is not really a resolution, does not resolve a conflict, and may weaken your position because parties may assume you have an unfair bias. Team members may think you are lacking skills or are not authoritative. Many experts don’t consider this technique as a conflict management strategy, that avoiding and escaping is not a solution. 2. Smooth or Accommodate ","405 In this conflict resolution strategy, you find areas of agreement and try to smooth out the situation and circumvent tough discussions. The smoothing technique gives more consideration to one party than the other. You downplay the seriousness and behave as if the conflict never existed. This technique is helpful in the following cases: ● You don’t have time to deal with it. ● You require a temporary solution to the problem. ● The conflict is minor and involves less influential stakeholders. Advantages This conflict resolution strategy does not require much effort. You can focus on essential issues by ignoring unimportant arguments. Situations can be potentially handled simply while bringing harmony, creating goodwill, and providing enough time to find a permanent solution. Disadvantages If you fail to bring a balanced approach, one party may take advantage since you are giving them more consideration. Other parties not being accommodated may question your authority or stop reporting conflicts. This conflict resolution strategy is not recommended as it often weakens the project manager’s authority. 3. Compromise or Reconcile In this conflict management strategy, you take suggestions from both sides and partially satisfy them. This technique is useful when the stakeholders involved hold equal power. You may use this technique in the following cases: ● All parties involved need to win ","406 ● When you have an equal relationship with both parties ● Collaborative and forcing techniques have failed ● When you need a temporary solution Advantages This technique brings quick results, lowers stress, and keeps all parties placated until you can find a permanent solution. You can cool off and revisit the situation later. Disadvantages This conflict management technique does not generate trust in the long run; all parties remain unsatisfied, and the conflict could resurface at any time. Morals are not being strengthened. You may have to ensure all parties abide by the agreement. 4. Force or Direct In this conflict management strategy, you agree with one party’s viewpoint and enforce their wishes. This is a win-lose situation and risks demoralizing the team. You can use this conflict resolution technique in the following cases: ● When you need a quick solution ● When you know that one party is right ● You do not have time to investigate ● When the conflict is not very important ● When the relationship with stakeholders is not essential Advantages This technique provides a quick solution. It requires almost no effort from the project manager and it may help establish their authority. Disadvantages Using this technique may cause a negative impression on you. You may lose opportunities gained from the opposing party’s viewpoint. You cannot apply this technique with powerful stakeholders. It may backfire and worsen the conflict. ","407 5. Collaborate or Problem Solve In a collaborative conflict resolution strategy, you discuss the issue with all parties and agree on a solution while considering multiple viewpoints. You may use this technique in the following cases: ● When incorporating multiple views ● If influential stakeholders are involved ● When a consensus is required ● If you want to distribute responsibility Advantages This is a real problem-solving technique that provides a solution to the conflict. It brings consensus, commitment, and shared responsibility for the outcome. This technique creates a win-win situation, builds your team’s confidence, earns respect, and establishes your authority. Disadvantages You cannot use this technique when you need a quick solution because it takes time and effort. It is generally used for conflicts that may affect your project, not all issues Which Conflict Resolution Technique Should I Use? The PMI does not recommend using any specific technique for all conflicts; it all depends on the situation and the stakeholders involved. For example, if two ground-level laborers have a conflict, what should you do? You may ignore it. However, if you see that some important stakeholders have a conflict, you will intervene, solve the conflict, and spare your project from harm. Although no single technique can be used for all conflicts, generally, it is thought that the “Collaborate or Problem Solve” method brings the most consensus and commitment. ","408 How to Prevent Conflict You cannot keep all conflict from happening, but following a few rules can minimize it. These guidelines are: Establish Strict Ground Rules: These help discipline team members which result in less conflict. Have an Effective Communication Plan: This can help you avoid many conflicts. Define how much and how often you will communicate with your stakeholders. Have a Better Stakeholder Management Plan: Your project is successful if your stakeholders are happy. Project management is all about managing stakeholders’ requirements. Solve Conflict Early: This takes less time and effort. Make sure an unresolved conflict doesn’t resurface again later. The Role of the Project Manager in Conflict Resolution As a project manager, you have to respond rationally and reach a solution that best serves your objective. While resolving a conflict, keep the following points in mind: ● Each participant deserves respect ● Be calm and rational. ● People are separate from problems ● Each participant should be listened to patiently ● There are always areas of agreement and disagreement ● You should explore all possible solutions. ● Mind your biases and don’t pick sides ● Don’t force or pressure participants ● Postponed conflicts may fester. ● Focus on the conflict, don’t let escalate the issue or generalize it. ","409 Improve Group Dynamics in the Workplace You’ve just been given an important project to complete. You’re excited and immediately begin assembling your team. You choose the brightest minds from each department in your organization and bring them all together. It’s a literal super team, what could go wrong? A whole lot actually. Negative group dynamics have been known to derail even the most promising of teams. In this article, we’ll look at what group dynamics are, the six root causes of negative group dynamics, and six strategies you can use to improve group dynamics today. Let’s get started! A Quick Definition For this article, when we say “group dynamics,” we’re talking about the way in which individuals behave when surrounded by others in a professional environment. Think about your place of work and the folks that you deal with every day. Do you all get along? Have you noticed that each of you assumes a distinct role or set of behaviors when working together? Does each team member build up the others around them? These are signs of positive group dynamics. But not every team operates effectively. Signs of negative group dynamics include a lack of trust, constant bickering, inappropriate remarks and derogatory statements aimed at other team members, and poor overall team performance. The study of group dynamics was pioneered by a social psychologist named Kurt Lewin in the first half of the 20th century. He is the man credited with coining the term “group dynamics” in the 1940s. His ideas are what most modern researchers have built their work upon. ","410 6 Root Causes of Negative Group Dynamics As we alluded to in the previous section, teams can have either positive or negative group dynamics, depending on the way that team members interact with each other. A positive group dynamic will result in better, more creative work produced more efficiently. Negative group dynamics result in the opposite. Here are the six root causes of negative group dynamics: ● Weak Leadership Leadership plays a major role in group dynamics. A strong leader will be able to successfully manage different personality types, solve any internal conflicts, and keep his or her group working towards its goal. Weak leadership, on the other hand, opens the door to a more dominant personality taking control. This can lead to a lack of direction and a focus on the wrong priorities. ● Excessive Deference to Authority Excessive deference to authority refers to team members who constantly agree with the leader of a group no matter what. One of the benefits of working on projects in a group setting is having access to differing opinions. This ensures that the right ideas are discovered more often. But if team members refuse to share their thoughts and ideas, opting instead to blindly follow their leader, this benefit is lost. ● Specific Personality Types There are five specific personality types that tend to disrupt positive team dynamics. If any of the people on your team can be classified in one of these ways, the overall success and effectiveness of your group will suffer. The Aggressor: The aggressor is an individual who is inappropriately outspoken and often disagrees with others, just for the sake of it. They tend to stifle other people’s ideas and can come across in a very hostile manner. ","411 The Negator: The negator is somewhat similar to the aggressor and is classified as someone who is overly critical of others ideas. One might call this personality type a “negative Nancy” because they always see the downside of everything. The Withdrawer: True to the name, a withdrawer is someone who withdraws from group sessions and doesn’t participate in conversations. While they don’t directly harm the group, they don’t add anything to it either. And their behavior may inspire others to withdraw as well, resulting in stagnant conversations and a lack of ideas. The Recognition Seeker: We all want to be recognized for our hard work and contributions. But the recognition seeker takes things too far and comes across as boastful. They also tend to dominate sessions and take credit for other people’s ideas. The Joker: Humor is a good thing. When stress and/or tensions rise, a funny quip can lighten the mood. Unfortunately, the joker is a person who consistently makes inappropriate jokes or simply makes jokes at the wrong time. Misplaced humor isn’t helpful. In fact, it can be harmful to group dynamics. Groupthink Groupthink happens when team members are more concerned with agreeing on a specific course of action than they are with choosing the right solutions. This mentality often prevents teams from fully exploring every option available to them and can harm group dynamics. Free Riding Free riding has been in existence for as long as people have been forming groups — so basically forever. Negative group dynamics of this sort refer to the phenomenon where some team members work really hard and others coast by. What’s interesting about free riders is, they often work very hard on their own. But once they’re asked to participate in a group setting, they become content to sit back and let others contribute more than them. This attitude is known as social loafing. Evaluation Apprehension And finally, we have evaluation apprehension which happens when group members feel that they are judged too harshly by others on the team. The natural response to these feelings is to withhold opinions. After all, if an opinion isn’t shared, there’s ","412 nothing to criticize. Like we mentioned earlier, though, varied ideas and opinions are what make group projects so potentially productive! Evaluation apprehension takes this benefit away. How to Improve Group Dynamics Now that we know what group dynamics are and the six root causes of them, we can discuss how to improve group dynamics for your team. We have six strategies for you: ● Understand the People on Your Team First and foremost, you need to understand the people on your team. What do they excel at and what areas could they improve in? What are their personality types? Do you have any natural negators or attention seekers? As the leader of your group, you’ll need to be aware of these things. You should also have a firm understanding of the stages of team development. There are five of them: the forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning stages. Knowing which stage your team is in is essential. It will allow you to better avoid potential problems and facilitate positive group dynamics. ● Address Issues as Quickly as Possible No group is completely free of problems. The key is addressing any issues that arise as quickly as possible. Have you noticed that a certain team member has recently picked up a negative personality trait? Talk to them about it before it becomes a massive problem! While conversations of this sort are never fun, having them is much better than letting issues fester and watching the productivity of your team plummet. It’s also much easier to have these conversations when problems first arise than after they’ve become habits. ● Assign Clear Roles and Responsibilities A clear sign of poor leadership is a team of people who don’t understand their roles and responsibilities. Unsurprisingly, a lack of clarity in this area also leads to negative group dynamics. Fortunately, you can eliminate this issue by ensuring that everyone ","413 on your team knows what’s expected of them and how to do it. Start with the overarching mission of your team. What are you trying to accomplish on a grand scale? Then clearly state what each person’s job is and provide them with the knowledge and tools to do it successfully. ● Eliminate Any and All Roadblocks When your team first comes together, there will obviously be trust issues and some level of discomfort. This is natural. It takes time to get to know people and the way they operate. To help speed up the “get to know you” phase and to start doing meaningful work faster, try a few team-building exercises. Just make sure that you, the leader of your group, participate as well! Team building exercises can and should be done by teams that have worked together for a while too — especially if group dynamics aren’t where you want them to be. These exercises can be a lot of fun and can help even the most different of colleagues find common ground. ● Emphasize Clear Communication Clear, open communication is key. To improve group dynamics in the workplace, you and your team MUST be able to communicate effectively. The method of communication — email, face-to-face conversations, video chat, slack groups, etc. — doesn’t matter as long as it works for you and your team. To help facilitate good communication, remember these tips: ● Share Announcements in a Timely Manner: Have an announcement to make? Don’t wait to share it! The faster you can get important information to your team the better. ● Encourage Communication Between Team Members: You should also be encouraging communication between your team members. If some in your group aren’t as comfortable sharing their opinions, look for ways to get them more involved. ● Always Be Respectful When Communicating: Make sure that you are a respectful communicator and that your team follows your lead. If someone is talking in a group setting, don’t let others interrupt them. And make sure that each team member gets a chance to speak. ","414 Always Stay Alert And lastly, you need to constantly be alert and searching for signs of negative group dynamics. Look for the root causes mentioned above: groupthink, specific personality types, evaluation apprehension, etc. If and when you see these root causes rear their ugly heads, address and eliminate them immediately. We also want to mention that frequent unanimous decisions should be evaluated. This could be a non-obvious sign that groupthink or free riding or one of the other negative group dynamics has crept into your team environment. Path to Better Group Dynamics Positive group dynamics are essential to the success of your team. It takes more than just the top talent and brightest minds your company has to offer to ensure a productive working environment for your group. You also need to understand how each individual operates and how to encourage them to work together in a positive way. The strategies outlined in this article will help you better manage your team and facilitate positive group dynamics. Good luck! ","415 Meeting Management So, what is meeting management? It’s the process of coordinating a meeting and managing the members of the team to get the results needed in the amount of time allotted. Meeting management is important for having more productive meetings. It helps manage everyone’s time in an efficient manner while accomplishing team goals. When meetings lack management, they can affect your bottom line, wasting time and money. 10 Steps to Meeting Management Process Having an efficient meeting takes a team effort. For those hoping to have productive meetings, there are 10 steps that take place. These steps are great for everyone on the team to know, and plan for when attending a meeting. ● Plan the Agenda ● Define the Purpose of the Meeting ● Determine Attendees ● Define Roles & Responsibilities ● Schedule the Meeting Invite ● Document the Meeting ● Transcribe Notes into Meeting Minutes ● Send Meeting Minutes ● Archive Meeting Minutes ● Schedule Follow-Up Meetings To learn more about the steps involved in the meeting management process, read each step more in-depth below: Step 1: Plan the Meeting Agenda This is the starting point for any meeting. For meeting leaders, planning an agenda falls under your responsibility. When leading a meeting, it is your responsibility to plan the agenda. The meeting agenda will include the following: ","416 ● Purpose of the meeting ● Attendees ● Roles ● Time and Place Step 2: Define the Purpose of the Meeting For all meeting members, the purpose should be the meeting in the agenda. For all attendees, clearly stating the purpose of the meeting for everyone is an important step to planning an effective meeting. Once the purpose is clear, communicate it to those involved, and plan meeting strategies that support the thoughtful involvement of those attending. More importantly, if there are multiple topics that need to be discussed, it is recommended to mention each topic and schedule time during the meeting specifically to cover each topic. Step 3: Determine Attendees Who needs to be at the meeting and who does not need to be there? When planning your meeting invite and agenda, it’s best to limit the number of people to only the members who absolutely need to be there. Keep in mind, meeting minutes exist to update those that need to know meeting results but don’t necessarily need to be involved. Step 4: Define Roles & Responsibilities After narrowing down the team members that need to attend, it’s time to define your roles. There are meeting leaders, facilitators, decision-makers, and note-takers that all have separate roles to contribute to having an effective meeting. Also, it’s important to note if updates are needed from team members for the meeting. These updates should be listed on the agenda for those members to see. That way, each attendee knows what’s expected of them, and there’s little confusion on what each individual needs to do or bring. ","417 Step 5: Schedule the Meeting Invite You’re finally ready to send an invite to your team. Create a meeting invite, include your detailed agenda, and schedule the meeting for a date and time that accommodates everyone’s schedule. Here are a few considerations around scheduling a meeting. Meeting Length An important aspect to remember is the length of the meeting. Based on the purpose of the meeting, and the topics to discuss, you’ll have an idea of how long the meeting will take. Location Be sure to include the location of the meeting. For instance, if it’s a specific room in your office, include that information in the invite. If you’re traveling to another place outside of your office, be sure to include the address, directions, and parking information. You may even want to include and schedule time on people’s calendars for necessary travel time. Alternatively, if the meeting is virtual, add the link to the meeting room, and other information needed, like a password, if required. Step 6: Document the Meeting Once everyone is in the same room (whether virtual or in-office), and discussion has begun, the notetaker will start documenting the meeting. Throughout the meeting, the note-taker will document the meeting and the decisions that result. They will either take written notes as these important decisions and updates occur, or use a meeting recording software to listen to and reference when forming meeting minutes. Step 7: Transcribe Notes into Meeting Minutes Once the meeting ends, note-takers will rely on their notes of the meeting, and transcribe them into minutes. Meeting minutes serve as a record of what was discussed and decided from the meeting. In addition to the decisions of the meeting, the meeting minutes clearly define the actions that must be taken, the ","418 member responsible for each decision, and the expected due date for each. Step 8: Send Out Meeting Minutes Once these meeting minutes are formatted, it’s time to send out your minutes, with action items included. Meeting minutes will serve as a summary of decisions and action items the meeting results for those that missed the meeting. For action items included, be sure to include the team member responsible for the task, and due date. In addition, be sure to provide links or attachments to any presentations or files that were used during the meeting. Step 9: Archive the Meeting Minutes After everyone has seen the meeting minutes, the next step is to archive the meeting minutes in a shared drive. By archiving minutes, you can reference meeting notes at any given time. Make sure the minutes are stored in a place where everyone can access them. In addition, be sure to store away presentations and other relevant files. Step 10: Schedule Follow-up Meetings Take a look at the next steps and be sure to check whether follow-up meetings need to be scheduled. Wil three need to be multiple meetings scheduled for each follow- up action item? This will depend on each action item and the next step. For instance, if an action item calls for time for the task owner and other members to review a document, a meeting should be scheduled at the appropriate date that was agreed on in the meeting minutes. ","419 Effective Group Decision Making Techniques As leaders, there are many decisions that we can make on our own but often, engaging the opinions and perspectives of others enhances the decision that is made. The group decision-making process can differ greatly from organization to organization because each team is unique. Group decision-making techniques can offer you and your team some structure when it comes to making effective decisions and finding alternative solutions. Fellow has outlined 10 group decision-making techniques that will help you reach a final decision, even with a large number of group members. ● What is a group decision-making technique? ● 10 Group decision-making techniques ● Best practices for group decision-making What is a group decision-making technique? Group decision-making techniques are different ways to approach making a decision during a group discussion with your team. The group decision-making process doesn’t need to be time-consuming nor exhaustive- it’s all about choosing the right approach for the specific situation and an approach that fits well with your team culture. You can engage decision-making groups when an outcome will affect your entire team so that everyone’s opinion is considered and everyone’s views on the matter are valued so that you can come to a final decision together. By using a group decision-making technique, you’ll see engagement surge, productivity rise, and issues be resolved with a lot more ease, especially among a group of experts. 10 Group decision-making techniques your team needs to know: ➔ Brainstorming ➔ The Delphi Method ➔ Weighted Scoring ","420 ➔ Nominal Group Technique ➔ Possibility Ranking ➔ The Stepladder Technique ➔ Pros and Cons list ➔ Didactic Interaction ➔ Decision-trees ➔ Consensus Mapping Brainstorming A brainstorming session is a type of group decision making that can be really effective when you need to raise potential ideas and solutions. This offers a free- flowing structure to the discussion and allows the whole team an opportunity to share their ideas on how to approach a particular situation. The main goal of brainstorming is to come up with as many suggestions as possible and to then decipher which idea may be the best approach. These meetings are a little more geared towards generating ideas than coming to a final decision but often, one idea stands out from others and can be selected as the most effective solution. The Delphi Method The Delphi technique is a good option when you need to reach a group consensus for a major decision. This group decision-making process takes all of the ideas generated by your team and compiles them for the leader of the group to break down into a smaller list of possible approaches. ","421 Those fewer options are then taken back to the group for further discussion and collective consideration. Essentially, the choices are condensed until a majority decision can be made. The idea is that when there are fewer options available a decision is reached with much more ease and with collective agreement from you and your team members. Weighted Scoring Weighted scoring is ideal to use in a situation where your team has many ideas for possible solutions but have not necessarily considered the implications of each decision thoroughly. The weighted scoring technique is founded on the idea that certain ideas or approaches may be riskier than others and therefore their implications need to be considered. Each item is evaluated against criteria such as the business value, costs, risks, and adoption. Each of these criteria is assigned a score based on the weighting (impact) of them. You’re looking for an approach that will score high in business value, high in adoption, score low in cost, and low in risk. After weighing each idea, you can tally up the scores to make an informed team decision. ","422 Nominal Group Technique The nominal group technique builds on the brainstorming discussion by including a voting process at the end. Not only does each group member cast a vote, but each person is given the opportunity to also give an explanation as to why they voted for whichever decision or option and why they feel as if it’s the best choice. Depending on the topic of discussion, there are a few different ways that you can use the nominal group technique. If the topic is more sensitive or controversial, you may want to engage your team with a survey with the option to remain anonymous. Otherwise, this technique can be used during your meeting in an open discussion. Possibility Ranking Possibility ranking means determining the best option through using a voting system or creating a list as a team to prioritize ideas and approaches. When you’re trying to make a collective decision about a question or issue that has many different potential outcomes, this can be a great group decision-making technique to engage. This technique can be used in an email, in a survey, or in your live meeting. You can begin with asking everyone to make a personal list of how they might rank different options or approaches and then combine lists to see if there are common opinions amongst the group so that you can come to a consensus. After you determine the average of the best option, you can take that approach knowing that the majority support it and agree with it. ","423 The Stepladder Technique Similar to the Delphi method, the stepladder technique encourages each team member to give their personal opinion on a matter, before anyone can be influenced by the rest of the group. This prevents groupthink and encourages authenticity and honesty in your team members’ answers. There are a few steps required for this approach: ● Step 1: Before meeting as a group, present the task to your team. Make sure to give enough time to everyone to think about their opinion or decision on how to best accomplish the task at hand. ● Step 2: Create a core group of two members and have them discuss the task or issue. ● Step 3: Add a third group member to the core group. This third member presents ideas to the first two members before they hear the ideas that have already been spoken about. After all three members have laid out their solutions and ideas, they discuss their options collectively. ● Step 4: Repeat the same process by adding a fourth member, fifth, sixth and so on, to the group. Make sure that there’s enough time for discussion after each added member has presented their views. ● Step 5: Make a final decision after everyone has been brought in and shared ","424 their ideas. Pros and Cons list In business, a pros and cons list is often referred to as Dialectical Inquiry and can actually be quite effective. Dialectical inquiry is a group decision-making approach that tries to fight against groupthink. Philosophical in nature said to have originated with Plato, this group decision- making technique asks group members to consider both the thesis and antithesis to any idea. When using this technique, split participants into two groups: those advocating for an idea and those advocating against it. Each group has the chance to explain and highlight why they feel as if their decision will produce the best business outcomes and why the alternative opinion may not make as much sense. Didactic Interaction Didactic interaction is similar to your pros and cons list or do dialectical inquiry, but unfolds a little differently. This approach is only applicable in certain situations but works very well when the right opportunity arises. The type of problem should be such that it results in a “yes” or a “no” solution. These are typically major decisions that will have a large impact on the way the business operates and will affect each employee as well. Such types of decisions require extensive and sometimes exhaustive discussions that can be time-consuming. Using this approach, you can simplify the process of investigation, waste no time and get straight to the point, without asking for any kind of elaboration. Decision-trees The decision tree technique is great for forecasting outcomes to different decisions. Decision trees are highly visual and operate as a type of non-linear mind map so that you can predict how certain approaches to a situation may turn out. Because this model of decision-making isn’t linear, you and your team can come up with creative ideas and make multiple potential decisions to understand which one ","425 has the most beneficial outcome. The decision tree starts out with one question, which is the root of the tree, which then branches out into many different possibilities. Branches will lead to nodes (outcomes) and subsequently, you can add a leaf, marking a rule or final decision. Consensus Mapping Consensus mapping begins with your team generating and developing ideas. It then attempts to arrive at a decision by pooling these ideas together, which have ","426 been generated by several task sub-groups. The ideas generated by the task sub-groups are further developed collectively and then narrowed down into a smaller number of ideas, with a stronger focus. Subsequently, all the ideas are again narrowed down into an even smaller number of ideas until the group is able to come to a mutually acceptable solution to the problem or situation. This technique is best suited for multi- dimensional problems, with interconnected relationships throughout the business, and involves several steps to coming to a final decision. Best practices for group decision-making Now that we’ve gone through some of the best group decision making techniques, we’ll leave you with some best practices to make collective decisions more effectively: ● Be clear about the decision being made ● Respect participants’ time ● Be mindful of deadlines or other time restrictions ● Be sure all opinions are respected ● Don’t allow one or two people to dominate all discussion ","427 Create An Effective Training Program Nearly everyone recognizes the value and benefits of workforce training. When done properly, training can make workers more efficient -- increasing production, revenue, and profits while decreasing costs, waste, and inefficiencies. Effective training can lead to increased compliance with regulations. It can even lead to a happier, more satisfied and engaged workforce, which in turn reduces turnover and costly new employee onboarding. So the benefits are many. But creating effective training isn’t easy. Some common problems include creating training that doesn't support a true business goal, or that's intended to solve a problem that training can’t fix, or without first identifying the true purpose of the training, or that includes too much information. Or maybe all of those things. So, how does one create effective workforce training materials? Below is an eight- step road map to help you create more effective training materials. Entire books have been written about each of these steps, so there’s far more to say than what’s written below. But this article should serve as an effective getting-started guide in your quest to create workforce training materials that actually work. An employee training program has the ability to be an extremely successful and useful resource — and continuing education is something that the workforce seems to value. In fact, according to TalentLyft, “90% of employees would stay with a company longer if there was an investment in learning.” ","428 360Learning explains that “employee training programs and, by extension, learning and developing departments are powerful tools in hiring, retaining, and retraining employees.” Employee training programs can focus on everything from onboarding new employees to addressing general or specialized skills, topics, etc. for current employees. Whether you’re looking to create one (or multiple) programs or just want to refresh your current training content, read on to discover steps to creating a successful training course or program — plus examples of training programs from top companies and tips for choosing the right instruction model. How to Create a Successful Training Course or Program: 10 Steps ★ Assess your needs and develop goals and success metrics. The first step to any successful training program is to establish your goals as a business or department and figure out what you need to successfully achieve them. It’s also important to establish key performance indicators (KPIs), which Investopedia defines as “a set of quantifiable measurements used to gauge a company’s overall long-term performance. KPIs specifically help determine a company’s strategic, financial, and operational achievements, especially compared to those of other businesses within the same sector.” Here are some questions to consider: ● Who is the intended audience of your training program? ● What are your short-term and long-term goals? ● What is the timeframe for those goals? ● How will you measure success? ● What does success look like to the employees? ● How will you know if participants have learned what you intended? ★ Determine the type of employee training plan. In discussing your goals and objectives, you also want to consider the type of ","429 training program you want to implement. Here are some ideas, courtesy of Workable: ● Classroom style vs. workshop style ● In-house seminars vs. industry conferences ● Individual vs. group training ● Skills-based training vs. management training ● On-the-job training vs. external resources training ● Professional, safety or quality training ● Online vs. in person ● Self-paced or structured timeline Other suggestions from Indeed include: ● Group training activities ● Hands-on training ● Instructor-led training ★ Keep adult learning principles in mind. Adults who are participating in an employee training plan often come to the table with more experience than young students in an academic setting. As eLearning Industry explains, you should keep certain characteristics of adult learners in mind, including: ● Experience will play an important part in any type of learning ● Learning should incorporate real-world applications ● Adult learners are typically ready and willing to learn especially if the content is interesting to them ● Adult learners must be involved in the process, whether that’s developing content or creating evaluation criteria ★ Develop learning objectives/outline. Remember the outlines you likely had to complete in high school English class to flesh out a writing idea? Well, the same idea applies here. What topics do you want to cover? What’s the most important information? How do you want to begin and end? Figuring out the answers to those questions will help drive the structure of your employee training plan — and ensure you hit all the important points. ★ Finalize your training plan. ","430 After you have an established outline with your learning objectives, now is the time for details. Tip: Keep your learning objectives handy so that you can ensure your plan adequately addresses each one. Tweak your plan as needed. Get feedback from colleagues. Move sections around. Fill in the blanks, add as much detail as possible and make revisions. ★ Design and develop training materials. A training plan is only as good as its training materials. As Indeed explains: “It’s important to have a design fully prepared before launching into development to ensure nothing goes missing or out of order. Remember to focus on the learning needs of the employees rather than what’s easiest for the trainer, and make sure your content focuses specifically on reaching the learning objectives. ” Training materials can include: ● eLearning ● Training manuals ● PowerPoint or slide presentations ● Job aids ● Workbooks ● Online materials ★ Implement training. Take care of any logistics ahead of time, like scheduling, testing technology to ensure it works and printing materials. During the actual training, explain the ground rules and convey your expectations before you get started. ★ Evaluate training. Evaluation and feedback is also an important part of the employee training process. It’s best to solicit this type of feedback from employees as soon as the program is finished so that the information is fresh in everyone’s minds. Consider online surveys or questionnaires for efficiency. Tip: Asking for anonymous feedback may take the pressure off your employees. ★ Measure success. Indeed recommends analyzing the results over the next month or quarter. Were the objectives met? Were there any tangible changes? “Determine whether the training corresponds with a rise in revenue, a decrease in costs, any changes in productivity ","431 and other metrics you choose to monitor.” ★ Reevaluate as necessary. Just like with any type of program, it’s best to reevaluate within a predetermined amount of time. What’s working? What isn’t? Have the objectives changed? Do you need to measure metrics differently? 15 Common Employee Training Models Employee training plans allow for flexibility and creativity, and there are a variety of options, depending on the goals of the program, objectives and audience. Here we list some of the most popular training models compiled from eLearning Industry, Indeed and Edgepoint Learning. ● Classroom-based training ● Interactive training ● On-the-job training ● Social learning ● Online training ● Technology-based learning ● Simulators ● Coaching/mentoring ● Instructor-led training ● Role playing ● Films and videos ● Case studies ● Group discussion and activities ● Management/leadership-specific activities ● Lectures What Makes An Employee Training Program Successful? The success of an employee training program will largely depend on whether the ","432 objectives and goals are met according to the predetermined timelines. But there are many other factors that can make or break a training program. According to BizLibrary they include: ● Program management — Is the program being managed effectively? ● Leadership/stakeholder buy-in — Does the program have support from the top down? ● Relevancy — Does the program contain real-world applications? ● Marketing and communication — Are employees aware of program developments and related opportunities? ● Post-training reinforcement — How can you reinforce the material throughout the year? What kind of refresher courses or materials do you need? Examples of Effective Employee Training Programs If you’re looking for examples of effective training programs, you have plenty to choose from. Here are some of the top ones, courtesy of TalentLyft: New hires at Amazon participate in a month-long training and hourly employees who have been part of the company for more than a year are eligible to participate in the Career Choice program, which provides access to educational benefits. In 2019, Amazon committed to more than $700 million for team member retraining “empowering employees to pursue their professional dreams while allowing the retail giant to close skill gaps.” In addition to a comprehensive tuition assistance program, AT&T offers internal employee training and development programs. AT&T University offers “an executive- led training program focusing on subjects like management and leadership.” The company also partnered with Udacity “to create online, self-paced coursework, allowing their workforce access to non-degree programs in subjects like data analytics and mobile development.” Etsy is lauded for its “well-rounded approach to employee training and development,” which features “combine proven methodologies, including ","433 organizational psychology, adult learning theory, and sociology.” Employees can also use traditional learning opportunities, coaching and online resources and participate in retreats. How to Choose the Right Employee Training Model As you can see, there are a variety of training models, and some will be better fits than others, depending on your objectives and audience. eLearning Industry recommends asking these questions: ● What’s the purpose of the training program? ● Who is the intended audience? ● Are there any constraints? It’s also important to consider whether you have the space and dedicated time. Would the audience be better served with an instructor-led classroom-type program or a self-paced, online learning module? Would group activities work better to achieve your goals, or is individual learning more appropriate? ","434 SMART Goals & Objectives What are SMART goals? The SMART in SMART goals stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound. Defining these parameters as they pertain to your goal helps ensure that your objectives are attainable within a certain time frame. This approach eliminates generalities and guesswork, sets a clear timeline, and makes it easier to track progress and identify missed milestones. An example of a SMART-goal statement might look like this: “Our goal is to [quantifiable objective] by [timeframe or deadline]. [Key players or teams] will accomplish this goal by [what steps you’ll take to achieve the goal]. Accomplishing this goal will [result or benefit].” How to write SMART goals Let’s use Jane’s objective to work through each component. S: Specific In order for a goal to be effective, it needs to be specific. A specific goal answers questions like: ● What needs to be accomplished? ● Who’s responsible for it? ● What steps need to be taken to achieve it? Thinking through these questions helps get to the heart of what you’re aiming for. Here’s an example of a specific goal Jane might come up with: “SPECIFIC: Grow the number of monthly users of Techfirm’s mobile app by optimizing our app-store listing and creating targeted social media campaigns.” ","435 M: Measurable Specificity is a solid start, but quantifying your goals (that is, making sure they’re measurable) makes it easier to track progress and know when you’ve reached the finish line. Jane and her product team want to grow the number of their mobile app users – but by how much? If they get even one new signup, that’s technically positive growth – so does that mean they’re done? Same goes for their strategy; how many platforms will they advertise on? To make this SMART objective more impactful, Jane should incorporate measurable, trackable benchmarks. MEASURABLE: Increase the number of monthly users of Techfirm’s mobile app by 1,000 by optimizing our app-store listing and creating targeted social media campaigns for four social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn. A: Achievable This is the point in the process when you give yourself a serious reality check. Goals should be realistic — not pedestals from which you inevitably tumble. Ask yourself: is your objective something your team can reasonably accomplish? Jane might look at her goal and realize that, given her small team and their heavy workload, creating ad campaigns for four social platforms might be biting off more than they can chew. She decides to scale back to the three social networks where she’s most likely to find new clients. ACHIEVABLE: Increase the number of monthly users of Techfirm’s mobile app by 1,000 by optimizing our app-store listing and creating targeted social media campaigns for three social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. ","436 Safeguarding the achievability of your goal is much easier when you’re the one setting it. However, that’s not always the case. When goals are handed down from elsewhere, make sure to communicate any restraints you may be working under. Even if you can’t shift the end goal, at least you can make your position (and any potential roadblocks) known up-front. R: Relevant Here’s where you need to think about the big picture. Why are you setting the goal that you’re setting? Jane knows that the app is a huge driver of customer loyalty, and that an uptick in their app usage could mean big things for the company’s bottom-line revenue goals. Now she revises her statement to reflect that context. RELEVANT: Grow the number of monthly users of Techfirm’s mobile app by 1,000 by optimizing our app-store listing and creating targeted social media campaigns for three social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Because mobile users tend to use our product longer, growing our app usage will ultimately increase profitability. T: Time-bound To properly measure success, you and your team need to be on the same page about when a goal has been reached. What’s your time horizon? When will the team start creating and implementing the tasks they’ve identified? When will they finish? SMART goals should have time-related parameters built in, so everybody knows how to stay on track within a designated time frame. When Jane incorporates those dates, her SMART goal is complete. TIME-BOUND: Grow the number of monthly users of Techfirm’s mobile app by 1,000 within Q1 of 2022. This will be accomplished by optimizing our app-store listing and creating targeted social media campaigns, which will begin running in February 2022, on three social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Since mobile is our primary point of conversion for paid-customer signups, growing our app usage will ultimately increase sales. ","437 Knowing how to set goals using the SMART framework can help you succeed in setting and attaining goals, no matter how large or small. Measure and Evaluate Employee Performance Data When you measure something – such as for a recipe or a construction project – it’s often a numbers game. However, when measuring human performance, you must use a combination of hard numbers and soft intuitive insights. Here are a few ways to measure and evaluate employee performance data: Graphic rating scales. A typical graphic scale uses sequential numbers, such as 1 to 5, or 1 to 10, to rate an employee’s relative performance in specific areas. Scales are often used to rate behavioral elements, such as \"understands job tasks\" or \"participates in decision-making.\" Or they could note the frequency an employee performs a certain task or behavior, such as “always,” “frequently,” “occasionally,” or “never” coming to work on time. You can adapt scales to your business needs. 360-degree feedback. This well-named system takes into account the feedback, opinions and assessments of an employee’s performance from the circle of people in the company with whom they work. It can include co-workers, supervisors and others. As you evaluate the input from many sources, you can note positive and negative similarities and trends. You can also identify areas that may need additional measurements and support. Self-Evaluation. Asking an employee to evaluate her own performance can be very effective. Often, employees may be more critical of their performance than you might be. You can use a form that requires multiple-choice answers, essay-type answers, or a combination of the two. Comparing a self-evaluation to your own objective appraisal can be helpful in finding similarities and discrepancies along with a richer understanding of employee’s ","438 performance. It can generate conversations that can be beneficial to employee development. Management by Objectives (MBO). Also known as “management by results,” this is a process whereby employees and managers form objectives together. They jointly determine individual objectives, how they align with company goals, and how performance will be measured and evaluated. MBO gives employees a clear understanding of what’s expected and allows them to participate in the process, which may foster better communication and increase motivation. Checklists. Using a simple “yes-no” checklist is a quick and easy way to identify employees that have deficiencies in various performance areas. It will also identify those that need additional training and knowledge to become more efficient. Measuring Performance Management Effectiveness Organ-i-sa-tions invest a sig-nif-i-cant amount of time (and there-fore mon-ey) in per-for-mance man-age-ment activ-i-ties. Indeed, before their per-for-mance man-age-ment revamp, Deloitte cal-cu-lat-ed their 65,000 employ-ees were spend-ing a total of 2 mil-lion hours a year com-plet-ing forms, hold-ing meet-ings and assign-ing and analyzing rat-ings. CEB found man-agers spent an aver-age of 210 hours per year on per-for-mance man-age-ment, find-ing that a com-pa-ny of 10,000 peo-ple spent $35 mil-lion a year on per-for-mance reviews alone. Yet so many of us — managers and employees alike — are dissatisfied with the quality and effectiveness of our performance man-age-ment systems. If this sounds familiar, it’s time you took action and began measuring the effec-tive-ness of your per-for-mance man-age-ment system. Below, we out-line five steps that will have you on the road to mea-sur-ing per-for-mance in a mean-ing-ful way. ","439 Step 1 — Do Your Research and Benchmark Best Practice If you are going to assess the qual-i-ty of your per-for-mance man-age-ment sys-tem objec-tive-ly, an impor-tant first step is to under-stand what”excellent” looks like for your business. Spend some time read-ing the lat-est research into per-for-mance man-age-ment trends and best prac-tice. Look at some case stud-ies of organizations who have suc-ceed-ed after revi-tal-is-ing their per-for-mance man-age-ment sys-tem. To help with this, we’ve created a free eBook on effective performance management, which summarizes a wide vari-ety of research and case stud-ies into an eas-i-ly digestible guide. Step 2 — Be Clear on Your Organization’s Goals for performance Management A num-ber of guid-ing prin-ci-ples have come to light in recent research into performance management —such as the importance of having regular future- focused “check-ins”, giv-ing fre-quent feed-back and decou-pling per-for-mance mea-sure-ment from devel-op-men-tal per-for-mance dis-cus-sions. But how effec-tive your per-for-mance man-age-ment process is will ulti-mate-ly depend on what you are look-ing to get from it. For this reason, it’s essential to be 100% clear on what your organization’s goals for per-for-mance man-age-ment are. This is some-thing that should be dis-cussed and agreed with your senior leadership. A sur-vey con-duct-ed by eRe-ward in 2014 found the most com-mon goals for per-for-mance man-age-ment were: ● to improve organizational performance ● to align indi-vid-ual and organizational objectives ● to devel-op a per-for-mance culture ● to improve indi-vid-ual performance ● to align indi-vid-ual behavior to organizational values ● to pro-vide the basis for per-son-al development ● to inform per-for-mance pay decisions ","440 Step 3 — How to Measure Organizational performance: Establishing Your Suc-cess Measures Once you are clear of the goals of your per-for-mance man-age-ment sys-tem, the next step is to estab-lish what suc-cess should look like for each one. Here are some suc-cess mea-sures for a selec-tion of the com-mon per-for-mance man-age-ment goals above, to show you how to mea-sure the effec-tive-ness of your sys-tem against your per-for-mance man-age-ment goals: In addi-tion to agree-ing on suc-cess mea-sures relat-ed to spe-cif-ic per-for-mance goals, it is impor-tant to define some mea-sures for your per-for-mance management processes (i.e. the actual mechanics). You’ll want to know how easy your employ-ees and man-agers find the process-es and tools they use, how time-con--sum-ing they are, how well they are imple-ment-ed, what pro-por-tion of peo-ple are fol-low-ing the process-es and whether peo-ple are demon-strat-ing the nec-es-sary per-for-mance man-age-ment skills. Step 4 — Evaluation of Your per-for-mance Man-age-ment System Once you have established your success, it’s time to start collating data and evaluating. To truly know how effective your performance management is —and to understand how to improve it — you will need a combina-tion of both qual-i-ta-tive and quan-ti-ta-tive data. Look-ing at quan-ti-ta-tive fig-ures such as com-pa-ny or team prof-itabil-i-ty or employ-ee engage-ment lev-els in iso-la-tion will not help you to under-stand the direct impact per-for-mance man-agement had on them— oth-er fac-tors will also be at play. Meth-ods of get-ting use-ful qual-i-ta-tive and quan-ti-ta-tive per-for-mance man-age-ment data include: Car-ry-ing out a ded-i-cat-ed sur-vey of a selec-tion of employ-ees and man-agers on their views and expe-ri-ences of the per-for-mance man-age-ment process and tools and how they have con-tributed to achiev-ing the desired goals Ask-ing spe-cif-ic ques-tions relat-ing to per-for-mance man-age-ment in your exist-ing employ-ee atti-tude surveys ","441 Con-duct-ing inter-views with a sam-ple of employ-ees and man-agers about their expe-ri-ences of per-for-mance management Focus groups Extract-ing data and reports from your online per-for-mance man-age-ment sys-tem (if you have one) Review-ing a sam-ple of objec-tives and per-son-al devel-op-ment plans for quality Step 5 — Take Action on the Results Once you’ve analyzed the results, you should have a clear idea of how effective your per-for-mance man-age-ment process-es are and which aspects could be improved. If the results are not as good as you had hoped, don’t be disheartened as you are not alone. A 2014 study found only 8% of com-pa-nies report-ed that their per-for-mance man-age-ment process dri-ves high lev-els of val-ue. More recent-ly, two-thirds of organ-i-sa-tions sug-gest-ed their per-for-mance man-age-ment system was ineffective. There’s definitely room for improvement. The key to improv-ing your per-for-mance man-age-ment is to involve a vari-ety of senior man-agers, man-agers and employ-ees in dis-cus-sions on how to make improve-ments. This will help you to get buy-in to the improved process and greater own-er-ship from those who have to imple-ment it. How to Improve Your Per-for-mance Man-age-ment System Here are five sug-gest-ed steps to improv-ing your per-for-mance man-age-ment processes: ● Summarize the results and areas for improve-ment into a pre-sen-ta-tion that can be eas-i-ly digest-ed by those out-side of HR. ● Con-sult senior man-age-ment on the results. Obtain their sup-port for mak-ing changes and seek their ideas for how to make improvements. ● Run focus groups with a vari-ety of man-agers and employ-ees from dif-fer-ent areas of the organ-i-sa-tion. Dis-cuss the results with them and ask for their sug-ges-tions for improvement. ● Decide on what actions should be tak-en to address the issues dis-cussed and draw up a pro-posed action plan. Dis-cuss this with your senior ","442 man-age-ment and manager/employee focus groups to get their feedback. ● Make any required amend-ments to the action plan based on the feed-back received, then imple-ment the plan. ● While involv-ing peo-ple in the redesign of your per-for-mance management processes is essential, they probably won’t be able to provide all the answers. Sometimes you’ll need to present them with options based upon best prac-tice from out-side of the organ-i-sa-tion. For this rea-son, you should make it a pri-or-i-ty to remain up-to-date with per-for-mance man-age-ment trends, know-ing that the field of HR is ever- evolving. ","443 CHAPTER 6: Project Management (PM) Tools ","444 Gantt Chart What Is a Gantt Chart? A Gantt chart is a bar chart that provides a visual view of project tasks scheduled over time. A Gantt chart is used for project planning: it’s a useful way of showing what work is scheduled to be done on specific days. It helps project managers and team members view the start dates, end dates and milestones of a project schedule in one simple stacked bar chart. Gantt Chart Definition A Gantt chart is a stacked bar chart that contains project tasks on a vertical axis and timelines that represent task duration on a horizontal axis. Summary elements, task dependency relationships and milestones in the project schedule are all depicted. The Gantt chart is named after Henry Gantt who popularized this project management chart in the early 20th century. Understanding Gantt Charts The Gantt chart is the most widely used chart in project management. These charts are useful in planning a project and defining the sequence of tasks that require completion. In most instances, the chart is displayed as a horizontal bar chart. Horizontal bars of different lengths represent the project timeline, which can include task sequences, duration, and the start and end dates for each task. The horizontal bar also shows how much of a task requires completion. A Gantt chart helps in scheduling, managing, and monitoring specific tasks and resources in a project. The chart shows the project timeline, which includes scheduled and completed work ","445 over a period. The Gantt chart aids project managers in communicating project status or plans and also helps ensure the project remains on track. Benefits of a Gantt Chart The chart identifies tasks that may be executed in parallel and those that can't be started or finished until others are complete. It can help detect potential bottlenecks and identify tasks that may have been excluded from the project timeline. The chart depicts things like: task slack time or additional time for completion of a task that shouldn't delay the project; noncritical activities that may be delayed; and critical activities that must be executed on time. Gantt charts can be used in managing projects of all sizes and types. These may include building infrastructure like dams, bridges, and highways. They may also include software development and other technologies. Project management tools, such as Microsoft Visio, Project, SharePoint, and Excel, or specialized software, such as Gantto or Matchware, can help in designing Gantt charts. Example of a Gantt Chart If the project is about installing new software on a server, the project tasks that require completion are conducting research, selecting a software product, testing the software, and installing it. A milestone is selecting the software. These tasks appear as vertical lines on the chart. Say the project duration is 40 days. Each task takes 10 days to complete, and each task is dependent on the previous task. A critical activity is testing the software in the development and test environments. The task start and end dates, duration, and milestones appear as horizontal bars. The percentage of work completed for each task also is displayed on the horizontal bars. What are Gantt charts used for? Gantt charts help visualize various tasks and projects that occur simultaneously with an organization, how far along they have progressed. They are used by management to plan and schedule such projects so that resources can be allocated in the optimal way and that projects that are prioritized can finish before less important ones begin. ","446 Who was Henry Gantt? Henry Gantt was a social scientist and management consultant who also held a degree in mechanical engineering. He worked in the field of scientific management, developing methods to streamline and increase the productivity of corporations and their workforce. He created the Gantt chart in the 1910s to help supervisors understand the progress of their labor force and to ensure tasks were on schedule. What are the components of a Gantt Chart? A Gantt chart can vary in complexity and depth, but will always have three key components: activities or tasks that are to be done, running along the y-axis; milestones or progress stages indicated along the x-axis (either on the top or bottom of the chart); and progress bars, denoted as horizontal bars, denoting how far along each task is at any given point. Toll Gate Reviews Tollgate reviews are a critical activity for the successful completion of your project. As with any journey, you want your project journey to stay on the path, heading in the right direction, and meeting important milestones on the way. This article will describe what a Tollgate is, how it is used in your project, and some hints on how you can prepare and not get hung up at your Tollgate. Six Sigma projects will follow these steps or phases. Each phase will have a set of activities and deliverables you must complete before moving on to the next phase. The Tollgate is a formal process that sequentially reviews ","447 and assesses your project’s progress through each of the DMAIC phases. During this review process, you will: ● Make a formal presentation of what you have accomplished followed by questions and discussion ● Assess the status of your project ● Review your activities and accomplishments and test for alignment and progress ● Revisit the assumptions of your Project Charter ● Make a go/no-go decision along with your Black Belt, Master Black Belt, Champion, Project Sponsor, and or Senior Staff on moving ahead to the next phase of your project If you make a no-go decision, you will either have to take further actions in order to pass the Tollgate, or you can decide to kill the project. Although you may be provided with a detailed checklist of specific questions and activities, here is a high-level summary of what you’ll be asked at the different Tollgates: ● Define: Have you and your team defined the opportunity from both business and customer perspectives? ● Measure: Do you and your team understand or have you gathered the right data to help understand the process? Have you baselined the current process performance? ● Analyze: Have you and your team identified the key factors (critical Xes) that have the biggest impact on process performance? Have you validated the root causes? ● Improve: Have you and your team developed improvement solutions for the critical Xes, piloted the solution and verified that your solution will solve the problem? ● Control: Have you and your team implemented the solution as well as a control plan to ensure the process is robust to change? ● Validate: Although not an official part of the DMAIC methodology, you may, about a year after you have closed your project, be asked to validate your results. You may be asked the following questions, “Is the process still in control? Are the benefits being realized?” ","448 A Tollgate review will usually take from 30-60 minutes to complete. The recommended agenda is: ● Review the objective of the specific Tollgate ● 15-30 minute project presentation ● Highlight any changes to the project charter ● Project benefit update ● Follow the DMAIC roadmap ● Tools used, results, conclusions ● Review project status ● Project plan, barriers, issues ● Review project plans ● Tollgate review questions and discussion ● Tollgate decision ● Determine action items and next steps 3 benefits of Toll Gates A Tollgate review has saved numerous projects by realigning and revising the direction it was moving in. Although it might seem like an inconvenience for you to prepare and present at a Tollgate, it is definitely in your best interest — and that of the project — to do so. 1. Keeps the project on track By stopping and reflecting after each phase of DMAIC, you will prevent any detours that could slow your project down or keep it from being successful. Discovering and removing roadblocks during the Tollgate will keep you moving forward and on track. 2. Stops bad projects Not all projects are destined to be successful. By allowing you to make interim evaluations and assessments about the viability of the project, you will avoid finding ","449 out at the end that your project had no chance of being successful. It’s frustrating to find that you needlessly wasted months of your time (and that of your team) working on a project that would never deliver the desired results. During the Tollgate review, you’ll receive input and feedback from the other people in attendance. By using that input, you will be able to synthesize these ideas into your analysis and recommendations and come out with a better result. Why is a Tollgate important to understand? You should view a Tollgate as a positive activity intended to help you and your project be successful. Understanding the purpose and value of a Tollgate will help you traverse the often tortuous route of a DMAIC project. 1. Understand required deliverables The Tollgate review checklist will give you guidelines as to what is expected of your project at that point in time. Inconsistent or contrary project accomplishments will have a detrimental impact on the progress of your project. 2. Preempt roadblocks By understanding what the expectations are for you and your project, you will be able to make the necessary course corrections to avoid delays and mishaps in your project. 3. Appreciate the role of Tollgate attendees Fellow attendees at your Tollgate can provide invaluable assistance in your project’s progress and completion. Appreciate that they are there to help provide input and feedback. An industry example of a Tollgate A Tollgate review is intended to be a positive experience for everyone. Unfortunately ","450 for our example, Mark, it was not. Although Mark’s project was of great importance to the company, he failed to do proper preparation for his first Tollgate. First of all, Mark was not totally aware of who was attending his Tollgate, nor was he aware of how they felt about the value of his project. Mark also did not do sufficient preparation for his presentation with his Master Blackbelt. Mark’s project sponsor had not reviewed the team’s accomplishments prior to the Tollgate. The stage was set for a potential disaster. And the Tollgate was a disaster. Mark was not aware that one of the senior people in attendance felt threatened by the project that Mark was working on. She immediately attacked his work, and since he had not properly prepared, his responses were poor. His sponsor was of little help since he hadn’t reviewed what the team had accomplished so far and didn’t really understand what the senior leader was talking about. Most of the other attendees were cowed by the senior leader, so there was no support from them. Mark’s saving grace was that his Master Black Belt was very experienced and not intimidated by the senior leader. He pushed back, and Mark got to live another day. The project was successful, and the company reaped a $6,000,000 hard benefit. Mark never repeated his slip-ups again. 3 best practices when thinking about Tollgates Most experienced Six Sigma practitioners have figured out how to prevent Tollgates from becoming a negative and unproductive activity. Here are a few hints that will help you avoid some of the common failures in a Tollgate review. 1. Know your audience Make sure that you understand who will be in attendance and how they feel about your project. You want to know whether you can expect them to be supportive of your project or if they may attack your work and that of the team. 2. Prepare, prepare, and prepare Be sure that you have fully reviewed your deck with your Black Belt or Master Black Belt. Have all the data and supporting documentation for what you and the team have done in that DMAIC phase. Be prepared for any questions you can imagine ","451 might be asked. Your project sponsor should be your biggest ally, so prepare him or her so they are not caught off-guard or blindsided. 3. Don’t be defensive There is much you can learn from the Tollgate attendees. Listen to their input and feedback and incorporate it as you feel appropriate. Don’t be defensive. Except for an outlier now and then, the attendees want you and your project to be successful because it will benefit the organization, and possibly themselves. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about Tollgate 1. Must I do a Tollgate after each phase of DMAIC? Yes. You need to pass the Tollgate for all the phases. If you skip one, you have the unpleasant experience of having gone down a blind alley, and you will have to back up and rework what you have already done. 2. How long should a Tollgate take? They usually last 30-60 minutes if the standard agenda is followed. 3. What is the purpose of a Tollgate? A tollgate review is a process for objectively evaluating the quality of project work at various stages of the DMAIC process. It provides the opportunity for voices external to the project team to provide input and feedback. Summing up a Tollgate Tollgates are a chance for you to review and reflect on the progress of your project. You will likely be expected to do a Tollgate review after each step of the DMAIC method. The outcome of a Tollgate review is a decision for you to move ahead to the next step, do some revision and changes, or to kill the project. A number of different people representing various elements of the project process will be in attendance. Their role is to offer you some feedback and input and to help you make the decision whether to go or no-go on your project. You will have a set of checklist questions to help you evaluate your progress and whether you and the ","452 team have completed the desired and required deliverables for the appropriate DMAIC phase. Work Breakdown Structure Breaking work into smaller tasks is a common productivity technique used to make the work more manageable and approachable. For projects, the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is the tool that utilizes this technique and is one of the most important project management documents. It singlehandedly integrates scope, cost and schedule baselines ensuring that project plans are in alignment. The Project Management Institute (PMI) Project Management Book of Knowledge (PMBOK) defines the Work Breakdown Structure as a “deliverable oriented hierarchical decomposition of the work to be executed by the project team.” There are two types of WBS: 1) Deliverable-Based and 2) Phase-Based. The most common and preferred approach is the Deliverable-Based approach. The main difference between the two approaches are the Elements identified in the first Level of the WBS. Deliverable-Based Work Breakdown Structure A Deliverable-Based Work Breakdown Structure clearly demonstrates the relationship between the project deliverables (i.e., products, services or results) and the scope (i.e., work to be executed). ","453 Phase- Based Work Breakdown Structure Regardless of the type of WBS, the lower Level Elements are all deliverables. Notice that Elements in different Legs have the same name. A Phase-Based WBS requires work associated with multiple elements be divided into the work unique to each Level 1 Element. A WBS Dictionary is created to describe the work in each Element. A good WBS is simply one that makes the project more manageable. Every project is different; every project manager is different and every WBS is different. So, the right WBS is the one that best answers the question, “What structure makes the project more manageable?”. ","454 How to Make a Work Breakdown Structure Rules to create a work breakdown structure: ● Include 100% of the work necessary to complete the goal. ● Don't account for any amount of work twice. ● Focus on outcomes, not actions. ● A work package should take no less than 8 hours and no more than 80 hours of effort. ● Include about three levels of detail. ● Assign each work package to a specific team or individual. Create a work breakdown structure Record the overarching objective you are trying to accomplish. This objective could be anything from developing a new software feature to building a missile. Divide the overarching project into smaller and smaller pieces, but stop before you get to the point of listing out every action that must be taken. Remember to focus on concrete deliverables rather than actions. Depending on the nature of your project, start dividing by project phases, specific large deliverables, or sub-tasks. Tips for making a work breakdown structure As you make a work breakdown structure, use the following rules for best results: ● The 100% rule. The work represented by your WBS must include 100% of the work necessary to complete the overarching goal without including any extraneous or unrelated work. Also, child tasks on any level must account for all of the work necessary to complete the parent task. ● Mutually exclusive. Do not include a sub-task twice or account for any amount of work twice. Doing so would violate the 100% rule and will result in miscalculations as you try to determine the resources necessary to complete a project. ● Outcomes, not actions. Remember to focus on deliverables and outcomes ","455 rather than actions. For example, if you were building a bike, a deliverable might be “the braking system” while actions would include “calibrate the brake pads.” ● The 8/80 rule. There are several ways to decide when a work package is small enough without being too small. This rule is one of the most common suggestions—a work package should take no less than eight hours of effort, but no more than 80. Other rules suggest no more than ten days (which is the same as 80 hours if you work full time) or no more than a standard reporting period. In other words, if you report on your work every month, a work package should take no more than a month to complete. When in doubt, apply the “if it makes sense” rule and use your best judgment. ● Three levels. Generally speaking, a WBS should include about three levels of detail. Some branches of the WBS will be more subdivided than others, but if most branches have about three levels, the scope of your project and the level of detail in your WBS are about right. ● Make assignments. Every work package should be assigned to a specific team or individual. If you have made your WBS well, there will be no work overlap so responsibilities will be clear. WBS dictionary What is a WBS dictionary? A WBS dictionary is formatted like the hierarchical structure, but it includes a brief description of each work package. When documenting a project, a WBS dictionary is often included in addition to a visualization of the WBS. It helps to clarify the scope of each task so that all team members understand their responsibilities. ","456 RACI Model Project management is constantly evolving in it’s technology and trends, from RACI to Gantt and back. It’s no wonder that sometimes it feels like a Pandora’s box of different decision makers, project roles, and responsibilities. This is particularly true if you don’t have a project plan and the structures in place to complete the task milestones from start to finish while managing the responsible parties involved. Without this, it’s pretty easy for the right hand to be in the dark about what the left hand is doing. One steadfast method involves the use of something called a RACI chart. In this blog, we’ll cover what the RACI model is, why it’s important for a healthy project management environment, and how to implement it the right way. What does RACI mean? The acronym RACI stands for responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed. This is how each of the 4 components is defined: ","457 ● Responsible: a manager or team member who is directly responsible for successfully completing a project task. ● Accountable: the person with final authority over the successful completion of the specific task or deliverable. ● Consulted: someone with unique insights the team will consult. ● Informed: a client or executive who isn’t directly involved, but you should keep up to speed. There are other variations of this method. RACI is the base level, the vanilla ice cream of responsibility matrices. Other versions add their own unique flavors — peanut butter, cookies, and more. RASCI, for example, adds the 5th level, support, to the matrix. This could look like a senior developer who works on another project but also has unique experience working with APIs. What is RACI in project management? Also called a RACI matrix, RACI charts are a type of responsibility assignment matrix in project management. These simple spreadsheets or tables highlight the different states of responsibility a stakeholder has over a particular task or deliverable and denote it with the letters R, A, C, or I. It’s typically implemented by color-coding each responsibility level and creating a simple table layout. ","458 Generally, nobody should have more than a single responsibility level for each deliverable or activity group in the RACI chart. In this example, we’ve given every person some level of involvement to keep things simple. But when you make a real model for more than four people, there’s often more white space. We will get more into how class RACI looks and functions later. Why do you need a RACI? The goal of the RACI model is to bring structure and clarity regarding the roles that stakeholders play within a project. This responsibility assignment matrix instills confidence in each responsible person because they know what they are doing— this type of stakeholder engagement is crucial, according to a 2020 study by Wellingtone. In fact, it was ranked as the highest-valued project management process. RACI provides a concrete and intentional framework to manage all relationships appropriately, from start to finish. A large scale project could involve many stakeholders, like: ","459 ● Government regulators ● VIP clients and project sponsors ● Company executives ● Business analysts ● Internal users of the product ● Customers ● Suppliers ● Investors Mapping all of their responsibilities out from the beginning and sharing them is an excellent way to avoid miscalculations and blunders that could cost you precious time and money. And of course, it will contribute to your overall stakeholder engagement efforts. Research-backed tips for effective stakeholder engagement Before we get into the technical components of creating a RACI chart, let’s dive into stakeholder engagement briefly. A recent McKinsey study highlighted three key areas for engaging external stakeholders effectively — a corporate purpose, active use of technology, and organizational agility. ","460 ","461 How can you apply this research? Check out these tips. 1. Map out deliverables and activity groups thoroughly before using RACI Don’t jump immediately into assigning individual responsibilities. Start by consulting with subject matter experts and accurately mapping out the moving parts. Only once you’ve got a clear outline of your project can you make educated decisions. That could be your Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) or a project roadmap. 2. Don’t be afraid to give responsibility to less senior staff Assigning the accountable role to a high-level executive or project manager for all tasks is a mistake. Since they have the final say on when a job is complete, you instantly create a bottleneck. Instead, don’t be afraid to assign that role to experienced staff on the project team itself, who is most familiar with the work. 3. Standardize the approach across departments and locations While a single project team is good, stakeholder relationships don’t exist in a vacuum. Your whole organization must get on board to truly maximize the return on investment. Make distributed responsibility and decision-making part of your corporate purpose. Everyone — from executive to intern — must be on the same page. 4. Use the right digital tools to implement RACI at scale A written memo isn’t enough to standardize your methods and remove departmental silos. Use digital tools to build a platform for efficient RACI implementation and stakeholder management. ","462 Who uses a RACI matrix? Even though the RACI model is a project manager’s useful tool for stakeholder management, that doesn’t mean it should be used for all projects. The deciding factors on who uses it relate to the scale of the project and the company structure. Use the RACI matrix for projects that are: ● Large-scale with clear-cut deliverables or workgroups ● For organizations with static roles and responsibilities ● Involving a wide variety of stakeholders for different aspects ● Spanning multiple departments ● In highly regulated industries ● Don’t use the RACI matrix for: ● Small, single-department projects — it’s likely not necessary ● Teams working with an Agile framework like Scrum In Agile organizations, cross-functional teams and collaboration is the default. So task responsibility depends on the employees’ initiative rather than a top-down decision. For Agile teams, implementing a hard version of RACI will likely not be helpful, as teams should be self-organizing. ","463 What should a RACI include? RACI model guidelines RACI has a set of general guidelines to help you implement the method successfully: ● Only 1 accountable per task or deliverable. ● Only 1 responsibility type per person. If you don’t follow this, the RACI matrix will be more confusing than helpful. ● The accountable person needs to have the authority to help finish the task. ● Only the responsible and accountable roles are mandatory for every task. Not every task is complex enough to need outside input or warrant informing anyone else. ● Prioritize effective communication with the consulting person. ● Always keep all stakeholders informed. Even the lowest level needs to know about updates and changes to the project. RAPID vs.RACI— What’s the difference? Sometimes when you want to define RACI, it’s important to use another method for comparison. RAPID and RACI are both two important tools for project managers, but they have different functions. As we have seen, the RACI method revolves around deliverables and the key person responsible throughout each stage of the process. RAPID however, focuses primarily on the decision-making process and the actions made by an organization. You can see the breakdown of RAPID here: ","464 While making a key decision is a part of the project management process, it’s not the whole journey. The RACI framework outlines who should do a task, who to keep in the loop, and who gets the final say. Analytical Tools 1. Affinity Diagrams 2. Tree Diagrams 3. Matrix Diagrams 4. Prioritization Matrix 5. Activity Network Diagram 6. Process Decision Program Chart (PDPC) 7. Interrelationship Diagraph Affinity Diagrams: Also called: affinity chart, affinity mapping, K-J Method, thematic analysis The affinity diagram organizes a large number of ideas into their natural ","465 relationships. It is the organized output from a brainstorming session. Use it to generate, organize, and consolidate information related to a product, process, complex issue, or problem. After generating ideas, group them according to their affinity, or similarity. This idea creation method taps a team’s creativity and intuition. It was created in the 1960s by Japanese anthropologist Jiro Kawakita. WHEN TO USE AN AFFINITY DIAGRAM ● When you are confronted with many facts or ideas in apparent chaos ● When issues seem too large and complex to grasp ● When group consensus is necessary Typical situations are: ● After a brainstorming exercise ● When analyzing verbal data, such as survey results ● When collecting and organizing large data sets ● When developing relationships or themes among ideas ● When reducing attributes to categories that can be addressed at a higher level AFFINITY DIAGRAM PROCESS The affinity diagram process lets a group move beyond its habitual thinking and preconceived categories. This technique accesses the great knowledge and understanding residing untapped in our intuition. Affinity diagrams tend to have 40 to 60 items; however, it is not unusual to see 100 to 200 items. Materials needed: Sticky notes or cards, marking pens, and large work surface (wall, table, or floor). ● Step 1: Record each idea with a marking pen on a separate sticky note or card (During a brainstorming session, write directly onto sticky notes or cards if you suspect you will be following the brainstorm with an affinity diagram.) Randomly spread notes on a large work surface so all notes are visible to everyone. The entire team gathers around the notes and participates in the next steps. ","466 Tips: Use markers so words can be read clearly even from a distance. With regular pens, it is hard to read ideas from any distance. Written ideas should be between three and seven words long. ● Step 2: Look for ideas that seem to be related in some way and place them side by side Attempt to look for relationships between individual ideas and have team members simultaneously sort the ideas (without talking) into five to 10 related groupings. Repeat until all notes are grouped. It’s okay to have “loners” that don’t seem to fit a group. It is also okay to move a note someone else has already moved. If a note seems to belong in two groups, make a second note. Tips: It is very important that no one talks during this step. The focus should be on looking for and grouping related ideas. It is also important to call these “groupings.” Do not place the notes in any order or determine categories or headings in advance. ● Step 3: Begin a discussion with your team From these relationships, attempt to define categories and create summary or header cards for each grouping or category. You can discuss the shape of the chart, any surprising patterns, and especially reasons for moving controversial notes. Make changes and move ideas around as necessary. When ideas are grouped to the team’s satisfaction, select a heading for each group. To do so, look for a note in each grouping that captures the meaning of the group. Place it at the top of the group. If there is no such note, write one. Often it is useful to write or highlight this note in a different color. Tips: Header cards should clearly identify the common thread for all groupings and should be descriptive of that thread. ● Step 4: Combine groups into \"supergroups,\" if appropriate Assign all ideas to the identified categories by placing ideas under header cards. Tip: Base assignment on “gut feel,” not through contemplation. AFFINITY DIAGRAM EXAMPLE #1 The ZZ-400 manufacturing team used an affinity diagram to organize its list of ","467 potential performance indicators. Figure 1 shows the list of team members brainstormed. Because the team works a shift schedule and members could not meet to do the affinity diagram together, they modified the procedure. The team members wrote each idea on sticky notes and placed the notes, in random order, on a rarely used door. Over several days, everyone reviewed the notes and moved the notes into related groups. Some people reviewed the evolving pattern several times. After a few days, the natural grouping shown in Figure 2 ","468 (below) had emerged. Notice that one of the notes, \"Safety,\" has become part of the heading for its group. The rest of the headings were added after the grouping emerged. Five broad areas of performance were identified: product quality, equipment maintenance, manufacturing cost, production volume, and safety and environment . AFFINITY DIAGRAM EXAMPLE #2 The following example comes from a hospital setting. Seeking to better understand the barriers to on-time delivery of medications, the team created an affinity diagram in six steps. ● Assigned a group leader for the activity. ● Agreed on a statement of the issue or problem. ● Tip: Stating the problem in the form of a question (“What are the barriers to on-time delivery of medications?”) can often prove useful. ● Brainstormed and recorded ideas. ","469 ● Tip: You have two main options for gathering ideas from team members. Participation by everyone in the group is assured with silent recording (option b, below), but traditional brainstorming can also generate ideas. ● Traditional brainstorming—In order around the group, each person writes an idea or response to the question on a 3” x 5” card while announcing the content of the card to the group. ● Silent recording—Each person writes responses on 3\" x 5\" cards or sticky notes, one idea per card, until all team members have exhausted their store of ideas. ● Attached all of the cards to the wall, grouping similar ideas together. For example, the team posted together all topics that suggested that the pharmacy may be understaffed. ● Tip: After posting all ideas the first time, fine-tune the groupings by moving cards from one pile to another to reflect closer ties. Team members should talk with each other as they arrange the ideas. ● Labeled each final grouping with a header identifying the general topic that all items in the group share. See Figure 3 (below). ● Reviewed final groupings and headers. By walking around and examining the posted notes, all members of the group had an opportunity to see the groupings and then to comment on them. Next Steps: Making Connections to Other Tools While an affinity diagram may present interesting data and useful ideas, the exercise itself should lead to further analysis. The team can now use an interrelationship diagram, for example, or even a cause-and-effect diagram to get to root causes for late medications. An affinity diagram, above all, stimulates discussion about a problem or issue, opening up possibilities for improvement or solution. Tree Diagram A tree diagram is a new management planning tool that depicts the hierarchy of tasks and subtasks needed to complete and objective. The tree diagram starts with one item that branches into two or more, each of which branch into two or more, and so on. The finished diagram bears a resemblance to a tree, with a trunk and ","470 multiple branches. It is used to break down broad categories into finer and finer levels of detail. Developing the tree diagram helps you move your thinking step by step from generalities to specifics. WHEN TO USE A TREE DIAGRAM ● When an issue is known or being addressed in broad generalities and you must move to specific details, such as when developing logical steps to achieve an objective ● When developing actions to carry out a solution or other plan ● When analyzing processes in detail ● When probing for the root cause of a problem ● When evaluating implementation issues for several potential solutions ● After an affinity diagram or interrelationship diagram has uncovered key issues ● As a communication tool, to explain details to others TREE DIAGRAM PROCEDURE ● Develop a statement of the goal, project, plan, problem, or whatever is being studied. Write it at the top (for a vertical tree) or far left (for a horizontal tree) of your work surface. ● Ask a question that will lead you to the next level of detail. For example: ● For a goal, action plan, or work breakdown structure, ask: \"What tasks must be done to accomplish this?\" or \"How can this be accomplished?\" ● For root-cause analysis, ask: \"What causes this?\" or \"Why does this happen?\" ● For a Gozinto chart, ask: \"What are the components?\" (\"Gozinto\" literally comes from the phrase, \"What goes into it?\") ● Brainstorm all possible answers. If an affinity diagram or interrelationship diagram has been done previously, ideas may be taken from there. Write each idea in a line below (for a vertical tree) or to the right of (for a horizontal tree) ","471 the first statement. Show links between the tiers with arrows. ● Do a \"necessary-and-sufficient\" check. Are all the items at this level necessary for the one on the level above? If all the items at this level were present or accomplished, would they be sufficient for the one on the level above? ● Each of the new idea statements now becomes the subject: a goal, objective, or problem statement. For each one, ask the question again to uncover the next level of detail. Create another tier of statements and show the relationships to the previous tier of ideas with arrows. Do a \"necessary-and- sufficient\" check for each set of items. ● Continue to turn each new idea into a subject statement and ask the question. Do not stop until you reach fundamental elements: specific actions that can be carried out, components that are not divisible, root causes. ● Do a \"necessary-and-sufficient\" check of the entire diagram. Are all the items necessary for the objective? If all the items were present or accomplished, would they be sufficient for the objective? Matrix Diagram for Project Management It is the arrangement of data in the matrix diagram that reveals “the strength of relationships between factors, causes, and objectives.” It is also an important concept that could be asked about on the PMP exam. Knowledge of the matrix diagram for the PMP exam encompasses (1) knowing how to use it on the job as a project manager and (2) understanding its value as a quality tool for the exam. What is a matrix diagram The power of the matrix diagram is showing not only the relationship between variables but the strength of that relationship. The matrix diagram is a planning and decision-making tool that can be used in any industry. ","472 Steps to create a matrix diagram To create quality matrix diagrams, PMP credential holders need to know the process behind this planning tool. The Six Sigma Study Guide is just one place where the process for matrix diagram creation is provided: Software is available to create matrix diagrams based on the system’s evaluation of the data submitted. Yet that software does not tell the PMP credential holder what the diagram means nor how to interpret the data. The project manager who earns their PMP should know the process behind matrix diagrams to maximize the use of this quality tool. Types of matrix diagrams The number of elements being compared will determine which of the six matrix ","473 diagrams to use: L-shaped, Y-shaped, C-shaped, T-shaped, X-shaped, and roof- shaped. For all types of matrix, the project manager can “easily visualize the relationship between objectives, factors, and causes within the organization they are observing.” ","474 Prioritization Matrix A prioritization matrix is a tool used for determining the most important issues or solutions. This tool can be used for any prioritization activity. In a Six Sigma project, it can be used for filtering or prioritizing either causes or solutions. For example, the cause-and-effect matrix is a prioritization matrix used for prioritizing causes, while the criteria-based matrix is used for prioritizing solutions. ","475 Whatever the matrix, the procedure used for prioritization is the same. The Six Sigma team identifies different criteria to be used for measuring different solutions. The relative importance of each criterion is determined and a numerical value indicating the weight of each criterion is entered in a column. Ratings are then assigned to the solutions against different criteria. The different solutions are scored against the identified criteria. Each rating is then multiplied by the criteria weights to obtain the weighted scores. The weighted scores are then added to find the cumulative value. The option with the highest total value is regarded as the option with the highest priority. What is the use of Prioritization Matrices? ● Prioritizing complex issues involving several criteria against which the issues are assessed. ● Assigning scores to the criteria or issues when data is available. ● Choosing key areas to be focused upon immediately. ● And, garnering team support and approval of crucial issues. How to Create a Prioritization Matrix? To create a prioritization matrix for determining key areas where Six Sigma projects need be implemented first: 1. Gather the team members required to participate in the exercise. ○ It is not necessary to limit the team to only the project team members. ○ Involve all stakeholders who would have influence on the items to be prioritized. ○ Ideally, the size of the team should be around eight. ○ Agree upon the scope and the duration of the exercise because there is a tendency to drift from the main subject of interest, which may consume more time. 2. Identify criteria against which the items to be prioritized can be weighed. Select the criteria according to your business and the nature of the process. 3. Assign weights to the criteria on a scale of 1 to 10. ○ Use an ascending scale while assigning the weight. Usually, the higher the better. ○ Draw consensus within the team on the weights. ","476 4. Assign ratings for each item to be prioritized against different criteria on a scale of 1 to 10. Alternatively, the team can also pick solutions one by one and gather votes for each criterion. Members who agree that a solution fits a particular criterion vote for it. Ensure that necessary information is available to the team before voting. 5. Compute the total score for each item. ○ Multiply the rating for an item by the weight. ○ Add the total scores for each item. 6. Continue doing this for every criterion of all the items. 7. Shortlist the items with higher scores for implementation. ","477 Process Decision Program Charts (PDPC) Process Decision Program Charts (PDPC) have 2 main uses: documents steps to completing a process and impact analysis. PDPC does this through a systematic exploration of a process and what could go wrong. This is a helpful project management tool in the Improve phase of DMAIC before implementing your plan but I find it helpful in the analysis phase after process mapping to check my understanding of current state. Process Decision Program Charts are considered part of the 7 management tools (7M) When Would You Create Process Decision Program Charts (PDPC)? Not every six sigma tool has to be used on every project. After all, it takes time and effort to implement these things. PDPC is best used when: ● You’re about to enact a new process. ● You’re delivering a large and complex project. ● The cost of the process failing is high. ","478 How to Create a Process Decision Program Chart? 1) First you start with a tree diagram of your process. Put your objectives on the first level, main activities on the second level, and the tasks at the 3rd level. 2) Then you brainstorm issues that could occur while performing those tasks. Process Decision Program charts (PDPC) uses brainstorming to identify issues. Step 3: Cross off issues that are unlikely to happen. Cross off the unlikely issues. ","479 Step 4: Identify countermeasures for the likeliest issues ","480 Interrelationship Digraph (Network Diagram) If you’re like me and you thought the spelling of Digraph was an error, it’s not. The difference between a digraph and a diagram is that a digraph is a graph emphasizing direction. A diagram can be any image outlining a plan or how something works. However, many articles on the web relate Interrelationship Digraph and Interrelationship Diagrams as the same thing. Other names for this tool include Relations Diagram, Network Diagram, or Matrix Diagram. The Interrelationship Digraph is a 7M tool. It often uses input from other tools – like a Fishbone Diagram or an Affinity Diagram to define drivers and outcomes in a process. ","481 An Interrelationship Digraph helps you see relations and influences between several concepts – even if those concepts are very different. You can also use it to identify critical issues and key drivers of a problem. Uses of Interrelationship Digraphs Interrelationship Digraphs encourages participants to view processes outside of a linear framework. Unlike a Fishbone Diagram, which singles out the main input to a process, the Interrelationship Digraph encourages multiple inputs and outputs. As a result, multiple root causes are drawn from the digraph. Interrelationship Digraphs are best deployed in groups for the purpose of brainstorming ideas. Also, heavily consider drafting digraph within a cross-functional team in order to capture everyone’s point of view. If done alone, the digraph may come across bias with limited function. When to Use an Interrelationship Digraph The strength of an Interrelationship Diagram comes through its ability to visualize relationships between complex processes. As arrows are plotted on the board, participants will see connections between ideas. Because Interrelationship Digraphs identify multiple drivers and outcomes in a given scope, this tool is best used for complex issues. The interrelationship Digraph helps team members break down the complexity of the subject at hand. When properly used, Interrelationship Digraphs will provide the team with more avenues to explore critical x factors. X Factors are any variables that cause something to occur. Should Affinity Diagrams, Tree Diagrams, or Fish Bone Diagrams Proceed Interrelationship Digraphs? The more, the merrier in my opinion! Each of these visual aids are tools to define your objective. Creating an Interrelationship Digraph will more fully explore how ideas connect after conducting an Affinity, Fishbone, or Tree Diagram. Also, the need for each of these tools depends on how well your team understands the project. Always consider how you can prove to stakeholders that your team has a complete ","482 understanding of the project. Steps to Construct an Interrelationship Digraph Let’s consider an example of a company that wants to source a new Electronic Resource Planning System (ERP). ERPs are databases used in large businesses to organize information and create reports across multiple departments. In this example, we will consider eight different departments found in a manufacturing environment. Step 1: Draft a Statement Draft a statement for the Interrelationship Diagram to explore. Consider using your Problem Statement found from the Project Charter if available. Write the statement on a white board for all participants to see. In this case, the statement is “Which Department is Most Impacted by an ERP System?” Step 2: Brainstorm Key Factors Next, have participants brainstorm key factors related to the statement. Each participant writes their ideas on a card or sticky note. You may gather ideas using the other 7M tools if created in advance. In the case of our ERP system, participants brainstormed eight departments that are primary users of the ERP system. ","483 Step 3: Categorize the Information Once participants have finished brainstorming, place one idea on the work surface and determine the relationships between the other ideas. Be sure to plot similar ideas in the same vicinity. Repeat till all ideas are on the board. In our example, the team placed departments in the same vicinity based on how regularly they interact with each other. Note how Production Planning and Accounting are centralized on the board. This shows that most departments have a hand in either of those two groups. Step 4: Analyze the Diagram Ask the team, “how does this idea influence the other ideas?” Draw arrows from each idea to the one it influences. Ideas that have arrows going out from them are causes or X factors. Ideas that have arrows coming to it are effects or Ys. Consider writing an explanation alongside the arrows to validate connections. ","484 Repeat for all ideas. In the example below, the team has drawn their arrows. Team members begin to see which departments are drivers or outcomes. The concepts with only arrows going out are considered drivers and the concepts with only arrows coming in are considered an outcome. With that said, we find there is only one true driver: Quality Assurance. All other departments are nested between causes and effects. Step 5: Count the Arrows Last, count the arrows pointing to and from each idea and record the totals. The ideas with the highest arrow counts deserve special attention. ","485 Back to our example, we see that Quality Assurance is one of the main drivers, which means the new ERP system needs to heavily consider how QA will operate with the new program. We can also see that Accounting is the most affected department. We can conclude that the most important stakeholders to the new ERP system is Accounting so buy-in from finance is crucial. All in all, Quality assurance is the main driver. Accounting will experience the greatest outcome of the ERP system. Lastly, all departments, except for HR, impact one another to some degree. Although each department has a say in the new ERP system, QA and Accounting hold the greatest weights when deciding capabilities and functions. ","486 Process Flow Metrics Work-in-Progress (WIP) The term work-in-progress (WIP) is a production and supply-chain management term describing partially finished goods awaiting completion. WIP refers to the raw materials, labor, and overhead costs incurred for products that are at various stages of the production process. WIP is a component of the inventory asset account on the balance sheet. These costs are subsequently transferred to the finished goods account and eventually to the cost of sales. WIPs are one of the components of a company's balance sheet. The WIP figure reflects only the value of those products in some intermediate production stages. This excludes the value of raw materials not yet incorporated into an item for sale. The WIP figure also excludes the value of finished products being held as inventory in anticipation of future sales. Understanding Works-in-Progress (WIP) WIP is a concept used to describe the flow of manufacturing costs from one area of production to the next, and the balance in WIP represents all production costs incurred for partially completed goods. Production costs include raw materials, labor used in making goods, and allocated overhead. A piece of inventory is classified as a WIP whenever it has been mixed with human labor but has not reached final goods status. Only some, but not all, necessary labor has been performed with it. WIP, along with other inventory accounts, can be determined by various accounting methods across different companies. Thus, it is important for investors to discern how a company is measuring its WIP ","487 and other inventory accounts. One company's WIP may not be comparable to another's. Allocations of overhead can be based on labor hours or machine hours, for example. WIP is also an asset on the balance sheet. It is standard practice to minimize the amount of WIP inventory before reporting is necessary since it is difficult and time-consuming to estimate the percentage of completion for an inventory asset. Work In Queue (WIQ) When you're talking about a production system, the Work In Queue refers to the work that isn't still completed; the work hasn't been processed yet. The Work In Queue term is frequent when we're talking about the Lean Production environment. The work in the queue doesn't exist in all systems. It only exists on systems where the worker is able to choose what projects he will be working on. On the contrary, when the customer demands need to be met at a specific time, the work in the queue doesn't exist. Touch Time Touch Time is defined as the total time worked on a car with value being added to that job. This is typically only a small proportion of the total time the car is in the shop; most of the time is taken up by waiting, moving and queuing. In a Lean environment if we are not adding value it's called 'waste'. To survive in today's competitive environment, you must look internally to achieve improvements in profitability, as work providers are reluctant to pay more for the same job. In the repair cycle you are only paid for adding value. The Key Performance Indicator (KPI) 'Touch Time', or another common term, Average Hours Worked Per Job Per Day, is a good gauge of how much waste you have in your processes. ","488 You may have heard of an industry target of four hours per job per day, very few repairers, if any, would achieve this goal. The average being between 1½ and 2½ hours per job per day. It is worth mentioning that these hours are real hours and not quoted hours at insurance labor rates. Most people we talk to would be shocked to think that they are only working on average 1½ to 2½ hours per job per day. Based on an average Touch Time of three hours, if a job has 15 real labor hours - panel and paint included - this would take six to ten days to repair. A common myth around Touch Time is that the technician’s efficiency plays a big part in it and if you improve their efficiency you will work more hours on each job each day. The truth is that management plays the biggest part in this KPI. Planning, scheduling and processes affect this KPI the most. The more idle time (WASTE) there is in the process the lower your Touch Time will be. Reducing your idle time (WASTE) is the best way to improve your Touch Time. In Lean we have an acronym for the main causes of waste, D.O.W.N.T.I.M.E. Let's look at some typical body shop processes that have waste and affect Touch Time outcomes: DOWN TIME ● Defects ● Over Processing ● Waiting ● Not Utilizing people’s ability ● Transportation of materials ● Inventory ● Motion of people ● Excess Production Booking Jobs in for Repair ","489 You can only repair a certain number of jobs each day based on the number of employees and available hours you have. Shops that bring in too much work on a Monday results in jobs sitting around until Tuesday or Wednesday before you start them, this will reduce your Touch Time. If a job has eight real labor hours and it comes in on Monday and you don't start it until Wednesday and get it out on Thursday, your Touch Time is only two hours (eight labor hours divided by 4 days equals two hours per day!) As you can see from this example you could have the most efficient technicians, but because you did not start the repair until Wednesday it impacts your Touch Time. Parts Not Ordered Prior to Arrival of the Job If you are not ordering parts until the job arrives your Touch Time will be affected if the job is held up waiting for parts (WAITING/WASTE). Repair Needs Not Evaluated Prior to Starting the Job Jobs that have been started and have to stop because a supplementary has been identified and needs approval before continuing (DEFECT/WASTE). Poor Scheduling If your technicians are waiting for jobs, and don't know what their next job is or are waiting for instruction, this means jobs are sitting idle, affecting Touch Time. Batch Priming If you are batch priming late in the afternoon this means potentially you have completed repair jobs sitting around idle, sometimes from early morning. This creates bottlenecks (OVER PROCESSING/WASTE) the next day as your painters start the day at the same stage the demand for the spray booth is heightened increasing waiting times (WAITING/DEFECT/WASTE). Old School Scheduling It is common to schedule one job to one technician or multiple jobs to one technician and wait until they are ready to start them. In a Lean environment, the focus is on keeping the vehicle moving, so scheduling is aimed at the vehicle and ","490 not the technician. Resources are pooled so the process continues, which commonly involves a 'TEAM' approach. How Do I Calculate My Touch Time? Most Body Shop Management systems will provide the data if the system is being utilized correctly. Some systems may have a different term for Touch Time. To do a manual calculation at the end of the month the equation is; Hours Sold ÷ Jobs Completed ÷ Cycle Time Days (Date In to Date Out). To give you an example, if a shop sells 1,250 sold hours (real hours not quoted) and completes 100 jobs and has an average cycle time of five days, their Touch Time would be 2½ hrs ....... 1,250 / 100 = 12½ hrs per job, 12½ hours / 5 (cycle time) = 2½ hours. How Will Improving My Touch Time Improve My Profitability? Improving your Touch Time will enable you to repair more jobs in the same amount of time with less required shop floor area. You will also reduce the amount of 'Work In Progress' you have, freeing up valuable space in your workshop. ","491 Takt Time “Takt time is the maximum amount of time in which a product needs to be produced in order to satisfy customer demand.” What is Takt time? Takt time is the maximum amount of time in which a product needs to be produced in order to satisfy customer demand. The term comes from the German word \"takt,\" which means \"pulse.\" Set by customer demand, takt creates the pulse or rhythm across all processes in a business to ensure continuous flow and utilization of capacities (e.g., man and machine). Why Do We Need Takt Time? Takt time is more than a metric of time — it’s a whole different way of thinking for running your operations. First, takt ensures that all the capacity in a business is planned and utilized and still meets overall customer demand. By and large, takt will help to deliver the right product (RP) at the right time (RT) in the right quantity (RQ) to the customer. You can achieve RP, RT, and RQ without implementing takt; however, this could lead to much waste of man and machine. Second, takt creates a constant pulse across your processes, which will immediately highlight capacity issues, synchronization issues among processes, quality issues and many others. How to Calculate Takt Time? Where production time available = total production time – breaks – maintenance activities – shift changeover – clean down time and ","492 Customer demand = amount of units required by customer/ time period Calculation Example Total Time: 8 Hours X 60 Minutes = 480 Minutes Breaks: 50 Minutes Time Available : 430 Minutes Customer Demand in 8 Hours: 100 Pcs Takt Time: 430 / 100 = 4.3 Minutes = 258 Seconds This example shows that the customer will need one pcs every 258 seconds. However, you might like to produce a single pcs in little less than 258 seconds in order to accommodate any variation in process steps, breakdowns, quality issues, etc. It is therefore essential that before you implement takt, you ensure that your processes are dependable and can deliver good quality, and that your machine has a very high uptime. How to Implement Takt Time? Takt has an easy formula, but it is one of the most difficult to implement in the Lean world. You can start implementing takt time by first measuring individual cycle times. Insert this data into the formula in order to calculate takt time. To begin aligning your process to the takt time, start dividing the work that goes into the process into value adding and non-value adding activity. Eliminate the non-value adding time and balance the workload of the operators. ","493 Bring the individual cycle times closer to the takt time. Keep the line balanced. In this case you will need fewer operators. What is the Example of A Real Life Takt Time? Consider the process of a water delivery system. The overall demand of water consumption is set by the homes that consume the water over 24 hours. However, the homes’ occupants do not consume the same amount of water across the 24 hours: There is a huge peak in consumption in the morning, afternoon and late evening, but for the rest of the day consumption is very low. However, the city water treatment plant cannot operate only when water consumption peaks, as the plant risks wasting much of its capacity. Therefore, the plant designs its capacity by looking at the consumers’ daily water consumption in liters per hour and also by considering seasonal fluctuations and the potential increase in consumption over the years to come. ","494 Based on this data, the plant calculates what the demand is every hour and adds a little buffer to address fluctuations, breakdowns, leakages, etc. The water treatment plant operates based on this demand rate so that each process step must deliver the same amount of water in that period. If some process is not able to deliver at the same rate, then either the plant needs to add more capacity or run that process for a longer time. The reservoir in between the plant and the homes (shown in the figure below) will smooth the impact of demand on the production process. The reservoir will also help with capacity issues related to the fact that as the water treatment plant is delivering water at a constant rate, consumption remains variable over the course of the day. Now the trade-off is between the cost advantage to run the power plant at the same run rate across the day and the cost of the reservoir. There is no one answer in the real world. Depending on your cost structure of man, machine and material, you must define how smoothly you can run your processes across the day, week or month, versus the inventory you may need to be able to adjust to customer demand ","495 variation. On the other hand, inventory is evil in the Lean world, but you have to look at total cost versus individual costs. Bottlenecks Bottleneck operations are those operations where the Load Cycle > Takt Time. Team members probably already know which operations have capacity and which are the constraints but what they don't know is the extent or the degree and amount compared to the other processes. In order to meet the delivery demands of the customer each bottleneck will need to be resolved so the loading is faster than the takt time. But where do you focus your efforts first? The study will only provide numbers. A small constraint in one area due to high scrap and rework may be much costlier overall than a larger time constraint in another area. These numbers along with reasoning on costs, scrap, and other subjective measures are for the team to determine prioritization for the improvements. This is why a Finance professional and key stakeholders must contribute to the team. As a Six Sigma project manager you can only present the numbers but also offer up what is NOT in the numbers that could shift priorities. The goal is to get the entire line balanced while removing waste. Waste reduction (rework, scrap, overproduction, and other 7-Wastes) should be targeted aggressively and then a loading study should be done prior to significant investments into line balancing. ","496 The Hidden Factory The Hidden Factory is the set of activity (or activities) in the process that result in reduction of quality or efficiency of a business process or manufacturing department, and is not known to managers or others seeking to improve the process. Six Sigma focuses on identifying \"hidden factory\" activities to eliminate the root- causes. One of the examples of Hidden Factory will be creating multiple versions of a status update presentation by the Project Management team because all of the requested information was not received by the due date from all the departments. Armand V. Feigenbaum (1920-2014), an American quality control expert and businessman, devised the concept of Total Quality Control, which led to the development of Total Quality Management. He said the hidden factory can account for anywhere from 20% to 40% of an organization’s total capacity. In the graphic below, you can understand why many reports of high yield are deceiving. ","497 You start with an input, which you transform into an output. This output is inspected, and a decision is made whether the output is good or defective. If it is good, the item goes on through the process. If not, an attempt is made to rework it. If that fails, the item is scrapped. At some point, the item makes it through and continues through the process. But, was the rework and scrap accounted for when determining the yield of the process? Eventually, an item will get through, so your final yield may look good — but at what cost? How the Hidden Factory works First time yield, or first pass yield, is the percentage of the time a product or service passes through a process step without any defects on the first attempt. In most organizations, this value of yield is far less than the reported final yield. Rolled throughput yield accounts for the hidden factory by not counting the rework and scrap in the calculation of yield. It represents the pure capability of the process to produce defect-free items. It is calculated by multiplying the first pass yield of each process step from the beginning to the end of the process. Here is an example of the calculations. Note how well each individual step is doing, yet the final RTY is poor. This would be the yield if all rework and scrap were not counted when calculating yield. The ","498 difference between 100% yield and the 61% RTY is the hidden factory. 3 drawbacks of the hidden factory The name alone signifies the downside of the hidden factory. The hidden factory hides your true yield, and costs are hidden. 1. Feedback loop Since the activities of the hidden factory are not obvious, there is no immediate feedback loop for correcting process deficiencies. 2. True cost is unknown If an operator has to work overtime because they had to rework something, the cost of overtime may not be directly attributable to the reworked item. 3. Silo mentality The hidden factory could be a result of your organization’s silo mentality. How often do your senior finance people visit the factory floor and question excessive inventory levels, process cycle times, process constraints, etc.? Do your manufacturing managers question their departments’ performance if they are within budget? Why is the hidden factory important to understand? If you are unaware of the hidden factory, then you don’t have a complete picture of what your process is doing. ● Can result in increased costs ","499 The hidden factory consists of rework, scrap, and other costs. If you aren’t tracking these costs, your entire cost structure may not be accurate. ● False illusion of performance Eventually, you will produce enough items to meet your customer demand. You will assume because 1,000 units went into your process and 1,000 came out, your yield is 100%. But what is your true yield if you don’t count the units you scrapped or the ones you reworked? Your true yield is likely less than your reported yield. ● Impact on profit If the hidden costs of your hidden factory could be identified, and steps taken to remove them, the effect on profits could be significant. Industry examples of the hidden factory Here is a list of activities you might find being done in your hidden factory. ● Having multiple versions of specifications, increasing the chances of using an outdated version and increasing the time it takes to update the right one. ● Operators rework parts at their station, taking extra steps that others don’t know about (which causes problems when that operator is away from work or leaves). ● Line supervisors speed up cycle time to catch up when they’re behind, not realizing it’s causing hidden part damage. ● Sorting mix-ups that allow defective products to reach the customer. ● Lag time in reporting quality data that allows problems to get worse. ● Making it difficult for people to share ideas and improvements with excessive red tape. ● Operators not carrying out preventative maintenance on machines, leading to hidden part damage and future machine failure. Feigenbaum referred to the hidden factory as “that part of your organization that exists to do bad work — not because you want to do bad work, but because the ","500 whole process is such that you are driven into it.” 1. What is the Hidden Factory and how does it emerge? The Hidden Factory refers to parts of a manufacturing process that decrease the quality or efficiency of an operation. The Hidden Factory forms when a defect flows downstream. When the defect is caught, a workaround is created as it is removed from the line, fixed, and placed back on the line. This may solve the problem in the short term, but when you do the same thing over and over again, the workarounds add up, and a hidden factory ultimately develops. A hidden factory is rarely the result of one problem in a process–if this were the case, it would be easy to solve. Rather, it is usually caused by multiple problems in a mixed system that must be solved at the same time. 2. What are the consequences of the Hidden Factory? If a product goes through a hidden factory, it not only costs more to produce, but also decreases the value that the customer receives. The Hidden Factory creates a long, slow feedback loop when you would rather have shorter, smaller ones. A hidden factory is a part of a process that is unplanned and unpaid for–in fact, according to Dr. Armand Feigenbaum, up to 30% of activity in a factory is unplanned. ","501 3. How can you recognize a hidden factory? A sure sign that hidden factories are appearing is when inventory or WIP begins stopping because the system can’t keep up with demand–just like in this famous clip from the show I Love Lucy, when Lucy and Ethel can’t wrap the chocolate quickly enough and must deal with additional chocolate as it comes down the line. Ironically, when we ask people to work faster as demand rises, the work actually slows down because the amount of inventory that diverts into the hidden factory increases. 4. How do you solve the hidden factory? You can solve or reduce a hidden factory by shortening the feedback loops within it. In order to reduce the hidden factory, you need a system in place to quickly identify what needs to be fixed and how to fix it quickly. 5. How can Industry 4.0 solve the hidden factory? Since the cost of sensors has significantly decreased with the rise of Industry 4.0, identifying and solving issues within a hidden factory has become dramatically more accessible. Capturing data from strategically-placed sensors and creating Pareto charts can provide the insights you need to identify the root causes of issues that need to be solved in order to shorten the feedback loops within the hidden factory. ","502 Above is an example of a Pareto chart displaying process data collected using Tulip’s Frontline Operations Platform. Tulip also enables process engineers to combat the Hidden Factory by allowing them to perform live root cause analyses, report defects, increase shop floor visibility, and automatically collect process and environmental data through custom Operations Apps. 3 best practices when thinking about the hidden factory The key to managing the hidden factory is to first be aware it exists in your organization. Here are a few tips to managing your hidden factory. 1. Use rolled throughput yield (RTY) to calculate your process yield Using RTY instead of overall final yield will give you better insight into what your process’ true capability is. 2. Sources of waste Use the 8 wastes of lean to identify possible sources of waste and rework. 3. Benchmark If possible, benchmark your key KPIs with best-in-class companies to help identify if you have a hidden factory. ","503 VALUE STREAM MAPPING (VSM) Also called: value stream analysis, lean process mapping Value stream mapping (VSM) is defined as a lean tool that employs a flowchart documenting every step in the process. Many lean practitioners see VSM as a fundamental tool to identify waste, reduce process cycle times, and implement process improvement. VSM is a workplace efficiency tool designed to combine material processing steps with information flow, along with other important related data. VSM is an essential lean tool for an organization wanting to plan, implement, and improve while on its lean journey. VSM helps users create a solid implementation plan that will maximize their available resources and help ensure that materials and time are used efficiently. PROFITABLE APPLICATIONS OF LEAN VALUE STREAM MAPPING The original VSM template was created by Toyota Motor Company and implemented via material and process flowcharts. This VSM illustrated the necessary process steps that existed from order entry to final product delivery and was useful for gaining a wide-reaching view of the company’s activities. It allowed Toyota to remove nonessential activities that created waste while maintaining the manufacturing process. The \"value stream\" portion of the VSM system centers on how value can be added to a product or service by changing the market form or function to meet the customer’s needs. This includes adding features and functionality to a product or service that benefit the customer without increasing wasted time and materials (also called muda, the Japanese term for waste) on the company’s side. Scoping Out Your Value Stream Map Understanding the scope of the value stream under examination is a good start when planning your lean process or value stream map. This map is a single area in your organization. However, when multiple plants, customers, or suppliers are included, an extended level map is created. ","504 Consider an extended level map as the view of the value stream at 60,000 feet, the facility level map at 30,000 feet, and the process level map at 10,000 feet. It is best to start at diagramming a facility level map before attempting to draw a process level map or extended level map so you do not optimize one area and suboptimize another. Step 1: Form a Team to Create the Lean Value Stream Map Form a cross-functional team of high-level managers and supervisors from throughout your company. Representatives from multiple departments, such as sales, customer service, inventory, operations, and beyond, will help ensure that information can be passed freely back and forth, and that items don’t slip through the cracks. Consider also adding important suppliers to this group because an outside perspective can be helpful. ● The ideal team size is about 10 members. Small teams can miss important items, while large teams can end up being difficult to manage and coordinate. Step 2: The Kaizen Kick-Off – VSM Planning After you’ve formed your VSM team, your next step is to hold a three-day kaizen event (see Table 1). Kaizen is Japanese and means \"change for the better.\" During a kaizen, team members begin developing current and future plans. Note: It’s important to include an individual with VSM experience to help facilitate the kaizen event. At the kaizen event, the team must complete four important steps: ","505 ● Determine the process family. ● Draw the current state map. ● Determine and draw the future state map. ● Draft a plan to arrive at the future state. Once these four steps have been completed and the team agrees with the plans and tactics, the VSM team can proceed to the next steps. Step 3: The Process Family – VSM Planning A process family, also known as a product family, is a group of products or services that go through the same or similar processing steps. To determine your process family, create a matrix similar to the example shown in Figure 1 below. Along the top row, write all the process steps your organization performs from a 30,000-foot point of view. ● In the first column, write down the parts (e.g., components, stock keeping units, finished good items, or services) your organization makes or provides. ","506 ● Place an X in the corresponding box if the part goes through the processing step. It’s important that this step is applied to all cross-functional teams and key areas within your company. This helps ensure all vital steps are included and no steps are overlooked. Step 4: Identifying Similarities Examine the matrix and look for sections that have similar or identical processing steps. Also look for sections that share about 80% of the steps. Consider items that share many of the same steps and procedures that can be created together—by the same workers using similar or related steps—more efficiently in a manufacturing cell. Once you’ve identified similarities, the team must then identify which process family it will concentrate on first. The list below represents some common reasons for picking certain areas, and they are areas that the VSM team should consider: ● Biggest \"bang for the buck\" ● Largest reduction in lead time or inventory ● Biggest impact to the customer ● Highest probability for success ● Most visible to stakeholders ● New product or service line ● Volume or quantity Along the top row, write all the process steps your organization performs from a 30,000-foot point of view. ● In the first column, write down the parts (e.g., components, stock keeping units, finished good items, or services) your organization makes or provides. ● Place an X in the corresponding box if the part goes through the processing step. It’s important that this step is applied to all cross-functional teams and key areas within your company. This helps ensure all vital steps are included and no steps are overlooked. ","507 Step 4: Identifying Similarities Examine the matrix and look for sections that have similar or identical processing steps. Also look for sections that share about 80% of the steps. Consider items that share many of the same steps and procedures that can be created together—by the same workers using similar or related steps—more efficiently in a manufacturing cell. Once you’ve identified similarities, the team must then identify which process family it will concentrate on first. The list below represents some common reasons for picking certain areas, and they are areas that the VSM team should consider: ● Biggest \"bang for the buck\" ● Largest reduction in lead time or inventory ● Biggest impact to the customer ● Highest probability for success ● Most visible to stakeholders ● New product or service line ● Volume or quantity Step 5: Creating the Current State Map – VSM Planning To create a current state map, collect the data and information by \"walking the flow\" and interviewing the people who perform the task. This is beneficial for two reasons: ● The team will have the opportunity to see the entire process and look for waste. ● The people who actually perform the work (e.g., operators, assemblers, technicians) can answer questions and clarify any misconceptions or preconceived notions on how tasks are performed. When your team is \"walking the flow,\" be sure to gather high-value information from employees, including: ● Cycle time or processing time ● Changeover time ● Reliability of equipment ● First pass yield ● Quantities ","508 ● Number of operators and shifts ● Hard copy information ● Electronic information ● Inventory levels ● Queue or waiting times The information gathered does not have to be perfect or overly detailed. As long as the data provides a relatively clear picture of major issues, the team can begin building its lean process map. Step 6: Start by Creating the Basic VSM Template Once your team has gathered and reviewed the information obtained while \"walking the flow,\" begin drawing the value stream map. Figure 2 below shows some common examples and strategies with VSM template development. Key areas on the map are: ● The upper-right corner for customer information ● The upper-left corner for supplier information ● The top half of the paper for information flow ● The bottom half for material (or product) flow ● The gutters on top and bottom to calculate value added and nonvalue added time Calculate the cycle time vs. the inventory time (in days) for the material and information flow. Each VSM will look slightly different depending on the process and how it was drawn. Figure 3 below features an example of a VSM current state map used for a metal fabricating company. ","509 If this is one of the team’s first VSM kaizens, have the facilitator draw the map on a large dry-erase board and then have the team members draw each of their own maps on paper (ideally in pencil). The current state map is usually completed by the second day, but it may need refining. Step 7: Creating the Future State Map ● What is the takt time? Takt is the German word for the baton a conductor uses to control his orchestra’s speed, beat, and timing. Takt time refers to how frequently a part or component must be produced to meet your customers’ demand. The formula is the time available (per shift) divided by the demand (per shift). For example: 22,000 seconds (time available) ÷ 200 pieces (demand) = 110 seconds/piece ","510 ● Are there bottlenecks or constraints? From the data collection during the kaizen, look at the cycle times or processing times. If any of these are greater than your takt time, you have a candidate for a bottleneck or constraint. This may be causing overproduction waste or work in process (WIP) in some areas, or extra processing time, such as overtime, to meet demand. ● Where can inventory (or queue time) be reduced or supermarkets used? A supermarket is a controlled inventory system—the downstream process removes items from the shelf and the process owners upstream replenish that amount to the supermarket. Look at raw material, WIP, buffer stock, safety stock, and finished goods inventories to see whether these can be reduced. Does it make sense to put in a supermarket replenishment system? The key is to find ways to reduce inventory in a logical manner. Also look for opportunities for paperwork to flow and not sit around, like in batching. ● Where can you improve flow? Is it possible to put materials into a cell or eliminate materials from stopping and waiting? If flow improvement isn’t possible, could a \"first in, first out\" lane be established between processes? ● What other improvements are required? For instance, does the reliability of equipment need to be improved? Are the first pass yield or quality levels acceptable? Is training in 5S (workplace organization) needed? Does a new layout for an area need to be created? On the VSM, place a kaizen burst (a sticky note or thought bubble) around any items to signal improvement is needed. Items may include low equipment reliability or first pass yield; long changeover times; large batches; any waste such as overproduction, motion, transportation, waiting, defects, or adjustments; and over or extra processing. ","511 Step 8: Creating the VSM Draft Plan During a typical VSM event, it is possible to create the draft plan based on the information from the future state map. The plan will need further refinement, especially in determining resources required, such as time, people, and budgets. A good plan, as shown in the example below, will include the description of the project, name of the project leader, possible team members, a schedule (or Gantt chart) of events and deliverables, an estimate of costs, and the impact, goals, or benefits. Process Mapping What is process mapping? Process mapping visually represents a workflow, allowing the team to understand a process and its components more clearly. There are a variety of process maps, and you may know one by a different name, such as a flowchart, a detailed process map, a document map, a high-level process map, a rendered process map, a swimlane, a value-added chain diagram, a value-stream map, a flow diagram, a process flowchart, a process model or a workflow diagram. These visual diagrams are usually a component of a company’s business process management (BPM). A process map outlines the individual steps within a process, identifying task owners and detailing expected timelines. They are particularly helpful in communicating processes among stakeholders and revealing areas of improvement. Most process maps start at a macro level and then provide more detail as necessary. Types of process maps There are several different types of process maps. Some of mapping techniques include: ● Basic flowcharts are visual maps, which provides the basic details of a process such as inputs and outputs. ● Deployment maps, also known as cross-functional flowcharts, display the ","512 relationships between different teams. These maps often use swimlane diagrams to illustrate how a process flows across the company, making it easier to spot bottlenecks or redundancies. ● Detailed process maps show a drill-downed version of a process, containing details around any sub-processes. ● High-level process maps, also known as value-chain or top-down maps, show a macro view of a process, including key process elements such as a supplier, input, process, output, or customer (SIPOC). ● Rendered process maps represent a current state and/or future state processes to show areas for potential process improvement. ● A value stream map (VSM) is a lean six sigma technique, which documents the steps required to develop a product or service to an end user. Process mapping symbols Process maps use visual representations, such as basic symbols to describe each element in the process. Some of the most common symbols are arrows, circles, diamonds, boxes, ovals and rectangles. These symbols can come from the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) or Unified Modeling Language (UML) (link resides outside IBM), which are graphical methods of notation for process maps. Most organizations will need to use only a few of the most common symbols to complete a process map. Some of these symbols include: ","513 ● A rectangle is used to represent a specific process and its activities and functions. ● An arrow is used to show both the direction of flow and the connection between steps. ● An oval is often used to show the beginning or end points of a process flow. ● A diamond is used to indicate a decision point. The process will continue by following a predefined path depending on the decision. ● A rectangle with one end rounded is often used as a delay symbol, showing a pause in the process before the flow continues. How to create a process map When developing your own business process map, you’ll want to leverage this ","514 methodology: ● Choose a process to focus on. To make the biggest impact, you may want to prioritize a process that’s struggling to achieve outcomes or a process that impacts customer satisfaction. ● Get the right people involved. Gather those who have deep knowledge of the process that you’re looking to optimize. These subject matter experts (SMEs) will help you determine the critical information within the entire process, such as stakeholders, sequence of steps, timelines, resources, etc. They can also highlight some of the problem areas, such as bottlenecks and redundancies, which may compromise efficiency. During this stage of the process, you want to document all relevant information around the process. ● Outline the process map. During this step, you’ll want to determine where the current process starts and end and the sequence of steps in between. While the level of detail can vary, information around inputs, outputs, metrics, and stakeholders are typically included. ● Use basic flowchart symbols to enhance the process map. Refine the current process map by leveraging basic flowchart symbols. Process mapping software is generally used to complete this step. ● Get feedback. Validate the enhanced process map with team members to confirm accurate process documentation, ensuring that steps are not repeating or missing. When stakeholders have agreed on the process steps within the current state, start to solicit feedback around potential process optimizations. This can involve the elimination of steps for simplification purposes or the incorporation of new ones to allow for more collaboration or quality assurance. ● Implement and observe the impact of process changes. Conduct a proof of concept (POC) with a subset of the team prior to scaling any changes broadly across the organization. This minimizes the risk to the business, and it provides the opportunity to incorporate additional feedback to optimize the process, allowing management to transition to a new process at scale more smoothly. Regular monitoring of processes will allow for continuous improvement over time. Why is process mapping important? The primary purpose of business process mapping is to assist organizations in becoming more efficient and effective at achieving a specific task or goal. It does this ","515 by providing greater transparency around decision-making and process flow which in turn helps to identify redundancies and bottlenecks within and between processes. Since process maps leverage visual cues and symbols, they make it easier to communicate a process to a broad audience. This can lead to increased engagement, as long-form documentation can be more tedious for both owners to create and for end users to consume. By leveraging pre-made templates within process mapping software, teams can easily collaborate and brainstorm ways to streamline work processes, enabling business process improvement. In doing so, businesses can also better address specific challenges, such as employee onboarding and retention or declining sales. Some specific benefits of process mapping include: ● Better enablement for scenario tests and assessments ● Increased standardization and awareness of roles and responsibilities ● Easier identification vulnerable aspects of a process ● Improved team performance and employee satisfaction ● Shorter learning curve for employees during training ","516 Work Instruction Many get these terms mixed up: policy, business Process, Procedure, and Work Instruction. In truth, most people create work instructions and refer to them as procedures. Or they will write a procedure, which is really a process. Some think these terms are interchangeable. What is a work instruction? What’s a Work Instruction? A Work Instruction is a description of how to perform a process in steps; For a step in a process, the instruction(s) on how to perform that step, sufficiently detailed to allow an inexperienced person (novice) to perform the work. Work instructions are more detailed than standard operating procedures. Assembly instructions are common in manufacturing or when you have furniture delivered to and you have to put it together. The little piece of paper that you receive with your product explains how to assemble the furniture. These assembly instructions are a form of work instruction. Work Instruction in the Document Pyramid The document pyramid lists the hierarchy of the four types of documents. ● Policies. Organizing principles that can represent rules to guide employees (employee policies) or mission statements used to guide a process or procedure. ● Procedures. A series of steps that achieve a planned result. ● Work Instructions. Detailed step-by-step guide. ● Records. Evidence (data) of an event that has occurred. A Work Instruction is Also Known As ● Standard Work when used in a Lean system. ● Job Aids, which are typically more pictures than words. ","517 ● Work Guides. ● Checklists. ● Recipe when used in cooking. ● User Manuals that may explain how to use a product. ● Assembly Instructions. Work Instruction Benefits Work instructions communicate exactly what needs to be done in a step-by-step manner. If you follow the work instructions as written, then you will reduce risks, minimize errors, and save time. ● Reduce Risk by detailing the safest way to execute something. ● Minimize Errors by following a tested method of how it was done before. ● Save Time by reducing risks and minimizing errors. You will do it right the first time. Differences between Processes, Procedures and Work Instructions Many people often confuse these three terms: business Process, Procedure, and Work Instruction. In fact, most people write work instructions and call them procedures, and define a procedure as a process. My objective in this paper is to provide the difference amongst the three terms to help you understand when to use each term in the Quality Management of your Business. The ISO 9001:2015 standard (Quality management systems - Fundamentals and vocabulary) defines the concept of Business Process as: \"A set of related or interacting activities, which transform inputs into outputs\". It is possible to qualify something more by saying that a process is a sequence of activities with a realization order in time, which converts a given input into an output (result, a product). Any activity, or set of activities, that uses resources to transform input elements into results can be considered as a process. Business Processes are modeled on the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard, reflecting the start of the process, the responsibilities of the activities, the sequence flows with all possible paths (to collect all the exceptions through decision points), the activities to be carried out, the roles that execute each activity, the events that occur in the process and the finalization (one or several end ","518 events) of the process. Do not confuse procedure with process. The ISO 9001: 2015 says that a Procedure is: “specified way to carry out an activity or a process”. When you have a process that must happen in a specific way, and you specify how it happens, you have a procedure. The procedure is mandatory and is necessary to develop any Quality Management System. Please pay your attention that not all processes need to have a procedure, and that the same process may have associated one or several procedures. A procedure will be determined by the need to detail the specific way of doing the activities by legal issues, regulatory compliance or company policies. The procedures are used for those activities in which several operations are linked and different people or departments of the company are involved (for example, Procedure for the presentation of Fiscal Models in the Treasury, Purchasing Procedure, Supplier Evaluation Procedure, Automation Procedure of Invoices, Procedure for Risk Work…). Work Instructions are documents that clearly and precisely describe the correct way to perform certain tasks that may cause inconvenience or damage if not done in the established manner. That is, describe, dictate or stipulate the steps that must be followed to correctly perform any specific activity or work. For example, Document of the Purchasing Area that describes the Accreditation Documentation of the Expense to be presented by the Employee in his Expense Note and the steps to proceed to present his monthly expenses; this work instruction would be linked to the \"Submit Expense Note\" Activity. The work instructions are mainly focused on explaining how a specific activity is going to be carried out, and they are mandatory. The work instructions are used to describe a specific operation, usually associated with a job. If they are not mandatory, we would be talking about a Work Guide. ","519 Main Differences between Process, Procedure and Work Instruction PROCESS PROCEDURE WORK INSTRUCTION Flow of sequences of activities that transform input elements into results Specific way to carry out a process Describe the correct steps to perform a specific task. ● What we do ● By WHOM ● Where it takes place ● When it happens How the work has to been performed and why How accomplish a specific task within a process with very detailed directions Orchestration the work Mandatory method Mandatory guidance Can respond to 0, 1 or more procedures It may consist of 0, 1 or more work instructions Focus on the instructions of 1 task Transversal by Business Units Cross-Functional or only 1 business unit Only 1 business unit Participate more than one role Participate more than one role Participate only one role Encapsulates activities Explains how to do but doesn’t get to the all details of how it is done All the detail of all the steps to follow in an activity Provides the workflow model in BPMN at a high level Document with both narrative and images, usually in the form of use cases and workflow diagrams Document with the maximum detail that explains step by step the instructions that must be carried out in an activity ","520 DIFFERENCES REGARDING QUALITY MANAGEMENT BPM helps execute business processes to achieve compliance with the Quality Management System so that the organization keeps all the documented information (mandatory records) for ISO quality audits. A procedure is usually described in a Word document, but could include the complete diagram in BPMN that explains at a high level the different activities to be performed. The ISO 9001 standard requires documented procedures for effective planning, operation and control of the processes within the quality management system of a company, which will include the documented information necessary to support the operation of the processes. The work instructions are optional for a system based on ISO 9001, but are generally included for consistent operations. The instructions are written to give instructions in a logical work sequence. PROCESS PROCEDURE WORK INSTRUCTION Ensures the preservation of all documented information (mandatory records) and traceability for ISO quality audits Documented information required (required by ISO 9001) for effective planning, operation and control of processes Instructions are optional for a system based on ISO 9001, but are generally included for consistent operations Ensure that the Quality Management System (QMS) runs correctly and consistently in order to run according to the required policies and regulations Ensure that the Quality Management System (QMS) be defined correctly in order to run according to the required policies and regulations Ensure consistent operations made by a person in a task according to the required policies and regulations ","521 Flow Chart A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents a workflow or process. A flowchart can also be defined as a diagrammatic representation of an algorithm, a step-by- step approach to solving a task. The flowchart shows the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting the boxes with arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution model to a given problem. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields. Overview Flowcharts are used in designing and documenting simple processes or programs. Like other types of diagrams, they help visualize what is going on and thereby help understand a process, and perhaps also find less-obvious features within the process, like flaws and bottlenecks. There are different types of flowcharts: each type has its own set of boxes and notations. The two most common types of boxes in a flowchart are: ● A processing step, usually called activity, and denoted as a rectangular box. ● A decision, usually denoted as a diamond. A flowchart is described as \"cross-functional\" when the chart is divided into different vertical or horizontal parts, to describe the control of different organizational units. A symbol appearing in a particular part is within the control of that organizational unit. A cross-functional flowchart allows the author to correctly locate the responsibility for performing an action or making a decision, and to show the responsibility of each organizational unit for different parts of a single process. Flowcharts depict certain aspects of processes and are usually complemented by other types of diagram. For instance, Kaoru Ishikawa defined the flowchart as one of the seven basic tools of quality control, next to the histogram, Pareto chart, check sheet, control chart, cause-and-effect diagram, and the scatter diagram. Similarly, in UML, a standard concept-modeling notation used in software development, the activity diagram, which is a type of flowchart, is just one of many different diagram types. ","522 Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams and Drakon-charts are an alternative notation for process flow. Common alternative names include: flow chart, process flowchart, functional flowchart, process map, process chart, functional process chart, business process model, process model, process flow diagram, work flow diagram, business flow diagram. The terms \"flowchart\" and \"flow chart\" are used interchangeably. The underlying graph structure of a flowchart is a flow graph, which abstracts away node types, their contents and other ancillary information. Building blocks Common symbols The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) set standards for flowcharts and their symbols in the 1960s. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) adopted the ANSI symbols in 1970. The current standard, ISO 5807, was revised in 1985. Generally, flowcharts flow from top to bottom and left to right. ANSI/ISO Shape Name Description Flowline (Arrowhead) [ Shows the process's order of operation. A line coming from one symbol and pointing at another. Arrowheads are added if the flow is not the standard top-to-bottom, left-to right. ","523 Terminal Indicates the beginning and ending of a program or sub-process. Represented as a stadium,oval or rounded (fillet) rectangle. They usually contain the word \"Start\" or \"End\", or another phrase signaling the start or end of a process, such as \"submit inquiry\" or \"receive product\". Process Represents a set of operations that changes value, form, or location of data. Represented as a rectangle. Decision Shows a conditional operation that determines which one of the two paths the program will take.The operation is commonly a yes/no question or true/false test. Represented as a diamond (rhombus). Input/Output Indicates the process of inputting and outputting data, as in entering data or displaying results. Represented as a rhomboid. Annotation(Comment) Indicating additional information about a step in the program. Represented as an open rectangle with a dashed or solid line connecting it to the corresponding symbol in the flowchart. ","524 Predefined Process Shows a named process which is defined elsewhere. Represented as a rectangle with double-struck vertical edges. On-page Connector Pairs of labeled connectors replace long or confusing lines on a flowchart page. Represented by a small circle with a letter inside. Off-page Connector A labeled connector for use when the target is on another page. Represented as a home plate-shaped pentagon. Other symbols The ANSI/ISO standards include symbols beyond the basic shapes. Some are: Shape Name Description Data File or Database Data represented by a cylinder symbolizing a disk drive. Document Single documents represented as a rectangle with a wavy base. Multiple documents represented as a stack of rectangles with wavy bases. ","525 Manual operation Represented by a trapezoid with the longest parallel side at the top, to represent an operation or adjustment to a process that can only be made manually. Manual input Represented by quadrilaterals, with the top irregularly sloping up from left to right, like the side view of a keyboard. Preparation or Initialization Represented by an elongated hexagon, originally used for steps like setting a switch or initializing a routine. SPAGHETTI DIAGRAM A spaghetti diagram is defined as a visual representation using a continuous flow line tracing the path of an item or activity through a process. As a process analysis tool, the continuous flow line enables process teams to identify redundancies in the workflow and opportunities to expedite process flow. For example, areas where many walkways overlap are causes of congestion and delay. Waiting is one of the eight wastes of lean, because it is considered \"unnecessary motion.\" The spaghetti diagram helps highlight major intersection points such as these that may not be noticed otherwise. SPAGHETTI DIAGRAM EXAMPLE The diagram in the figure below reflects a study done by a health department administrative office. The intent of the study was to identify ways to shorten the ","526 walking time from one activity to another for frequently performed tasks. Improving staff collaboration was a secondary benefit of creating the spaghetti diagram. The health department quality improvement coordinator facilitated a brainstorming session to identify areas of congestion and wasted movement among the office personnel. Focusing on a common goal brought the team closer together while highlighting the purpose for placement of some work areas. The spaghetti diagram helped the team see how they might rearrange work areas for optimum efficiency. ","527 Gemba Walk Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. From such a perspective, most of the contemporary managers seem to be insane. Why? Because you cannot expect different results from your team by sitting in your corner office and only attending KPI meetings. Instead, you need to see where the real work happens. You need to do Gemba walks. The Gemba walk is an essential part of the Lean management philosophy. Its initial purpose is to allow managers and leaders to observe the actual work process, engage with employees, gain knowledge about the work process, and explore opportunities for continuous improvement. Let’s explore the Gemba walk in detail. What Is a Gemba Walk Actually? The term “Gemba” comes from Japanese, and it means “the real place”. In Lean management, “Gemba” is the most important place for a team as it is the place where the real work happens. Quite simply, for rock bands, the “Gemba” is the recording studio. For Formula 1 teams, the “Gemba” is wherever the car is. For manufacturers, it’s the factory floor and so on. In other words, it is where the real work happens, so you can observe and analyze it. The Gemba walk is a concept developed by Taiichi Ohno, who is often considered the father of Just-in-time production. By developing such a concept, Ohno offers a real opportunity for executives to leave their daily routine, see where the real work happens, and build relationships with workers based on mutual trust. There are 3 important elements of this lean manufacturing tool: Go and see. The main idea of the Gemba walk is for managers and leaders on every ","528 level to take regular walks around the shop floor and to be involved in finding wasteful activities. Ask why. A Gemba walk's main objective is to explore the value stream in detail and locate its problematic parts through active communication. A good leader is always eager to listen rather than talk. Here is why you may use different techniques such as 5 whys in order to identify problematic parts of the process. Respect people. Keep in mind that a Gemba walk is not a “boss walk”. Pointing fingers and blaming people is exactly what you don’t have to do. You are not there to judge and review results. You are there to collaborate with the team and find problems together. Try to focus on finding the weak spots of the process, not of the people. 7 Steps to Follow When You Go to Gemba Before you walk the shop floor, you need to make a plan and follow the steps. The plan should depend on your goals and objectives. Sometimes it may be unstructured, for example, if you are new to the organization, while in other cases, your plan will be much more precise because you will be more familiar with the details. In any case, be prepared for the Gemba walk. Otherwise, it will be inefficient. Now, let’s define some basic steps. ● Pick a theme. When you go to Gemba, you have to choose a theme. This will help you focus all your efforts and be effective. There are different themes you may want to explore, such as productivity, cost efficiency, safety, etc. In order to be as precise as possible, you will also need to prepare a list of questions you are going to ask. ● Prepare your team. The team that will be observed should be prepared for what is going to happen. All team members need to have a clear understanding that the Gemba walk is a common process where the final destination is continuous improvement. This way, workers will feel much more comfortable and willing to collaborate. ● Focus on the process, not on people. You need to remember that a Gemba ","529 walk is not the right time to evaluate your team's performance. The main purpose is to observe, understand, and improve the process. If you focus on people’s personal abilities, you will only face resistance. ● Be where the value stream is. Following the value chain will give you the best opportunities to identify areas with a high potential for waste activities. Eliminating those activities will help you improve your overall performance. ● Record your observations. Don’t make suggestions during the walk. Write down everything that grabs your attention or even record it with your smartphone. In some cases, you will probably be tempted to offer a solution immediately, but this would be wrong. Leave the analysis for later. You will be much more precise after you have all the facts available. Furthermore, the broad overview can offer you opportunities to use effective problem-solving tools such as the PDCA cycle. Much better than an instant gut feeling. ● An extra pair of eyes. It may be a good idea to invite a colleague from another department. Someone with totally different daily tasks. People who are less familiar with the processes usually have a fresh perspective and ask different questions that you may never ask. ● Follow-up. Even if you don’t find anything significant during your Gemba walk, you need to share with the team what you have learned or seen. Otherwise, the team will only have the feeling of being watched. If you are going to take action after the walk, inform the team about the upcoming changes and why they are necessary. Gemba Walk Checklist Every time you perform a Gemba walk, you need to prepare a checklist in advance. This list will help you focus and target your efforts. The checklist has to include questions that will help you understand the process you are going to observe in a better way. Your questions may vary depending on the theme of your Gemba walk. Here are some basic Gemba walk checklist questions: These questions will defer when exploring different areas such as problem-solving, innovation, resources, tools, etc. So before you go, Gemba, prepare your checklist ","530 carefully based on the area you want to investigate. Post-Gemba Walk Before you take any actions based on your Gemba walk observations, you will need some time to organize your thoughts and notes. Feedback is important, but early feedback may be devastating. Here is why you need to sit down with the leadership team and carefully analyze the situation. You can even invite some of the workers who you’ve observed. For example, the ones who gave you the most insightful information. ","531 Use all the data that you collected as part of your continuous improvement process, also known as a Gemba Kaizen circle. It is a meeting held after each Gemba walk that may include a few participants from different departments. The main purpose is to have as many different points of view as possible to make the best decision. A decision that will actually bring improvement. It is important to go around the shop floor and collect insightful information about what needs improvement. However, what matters most is to go back to where you started. A post-Gemba walk closes the loop and shows respect to the people that have been observed. This will make it much easier to lead a successful Gemba walk in the future. In Summary Performing Gemba walks on a regular basis can offer some significant advantages like: ● Building stable relationships with those who actually do the work and create value. ● Identifying problems and taking actions for achieving continuous improvement much faster. ● Clearly communicating goals and objectives leading to increased employee engagement. ","532 CHAPTER 7: RISK ANALYSIS & MANAGEMENT ","533 Risk analysis and mitigation is important in managing any project. Six Sigma is no different in this regard. You’ll need to understand what risk is, how it can affect your project, and what to do about it. “Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing. -Warren Buffett” What is Risk? Put simply, a risk is a chance of something negative happening. In the context of Six Sigma, risks are things that can delay, halt, or harm your project. There are a few different types of risk: ● External: Occurrences outside your company that you have little to no control over. For example, natural disasters, social changes, government policy modifications. ● Consequential: Things that happen because of something the company does. For example, a new product receives a negative reaction and public opinion declines. ● Personal: Issues arising from staffing issues, management problems and the like. For example, a subject matter expert resigns, leaving you without a key source of knowledge. ● Technical: Problems with technology and automation. For example, a company might find that their current automated production hardware can’t be configured to use a new algorithm that would decrease production time. ● Supply: Every project requires some resources. In most cases, you’ll need these resources – whether physical or intangible – to be supplied. For example, you might need material for producing a new part. Conversely, you might be reliant on getting enough cloud resources to test a new SaaS product. Note: You’ll find that every industry and company tends to define its risk categories ","534 differently, according to need. You’ll rarely use the exact categories mentioned above. What matters is that you understand the broad varieties and sources of risk – then you can adapt as needed. “Risk is what’s left over when you think you’ve thought of everything. -Carl Richards, Future Babble” What We Can Do About Risk Every project will contain risks. Some of them you’ll be aware of; some of them will hit out of the blue. No matter how hard you try, you can’t eliminate all risk from a project. So why are we even talking about this? Because through risk analysis and mitigation, you can decrease the chances of big negative effects on your project results. Or in other words: you can give your projects their best possible chance of success. Risk analysis and mitigation requires identifying your risks, understanding how they might affect your project, and then figuring out what you can do to minimize their effects. Risk Mitigation vs Risk Avoidance You’ll sometimes see ‘mitigation’ and ‘avoidance’ used together, but when it comes to risk, these are quite different concepts. That’s because while risk analysis and mitigation focuses on handling risky situations, risk avoidance tries to eliminate it. ","535 “Isn’t it good to avoid all risks?” you might ask. Emotionally, yes. But every great endeavor involves an element of risk. Remove all risk from your project, and you end up with a very boring, very bland, uninspiring result. All good projects will have risks attached to them. Your job isn’t to take away all the risks – it’s to minimize their negative effects. “And the trouble is, if you don’t risk anything, you risk even more. -Erica Jong” How to Identify Risks So you know what risk is, and you know the main types of risk you could encounter. How do you actually identify the risks your particular project could face? There are a few methods you could use: Brainstorming: Sit down with team members and subject matter experts to throw around some ideas for risks in the major risk categories. Learned lessons: What did you learn from previous projects? Are any of the negatives from these applicable to the new project? Keystones: What are the important supports on which the project relies? These could be people, regulatory requirements, a piece of technology, an environmental situation. For example, say you’re designing a new piece of hardware for the building industry. Your keystones might be a supply of cheap steel from overseas and a continued boom in the commercial building industry. Assumptions: This is a tricky one, because it requires you to question points that you unconsciously consider factual. Sit down with your team to identify assumptions that you have about the project. For example, all members of your team will always be available to work in the office. Fault tree analysis: This tool allows you to chart a process and its potential failure points. ","536 How to Analyze Risks Once you’ve identified your risks, the next step is to analyze them. Analysis allows you to understand the risks that your project faces. You’ll then be able to prioritize them by severity and likelihood. Properly analyzing your risks at this stage ensures that: ● The most dangerous risks can be dealt with appropriately. ● You don’t waste resources countering risks that aren’t important. ● Your team can channel their efforts into getting the most benefit. ● The project is safeguarded wherever practical. Good risk analysis improves stakeholder confidence, minimizes unexpected expenditures, and allows for appropriate resource allocation. Risk analysis tools There are a few tools that you can use in your risk analysis: ● Risk assessment matrix ● Feasibility study ● SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) ● PEST analysis (political, environmental, social and technological) ● Failure Mode Effects Analysis ● Consequential metrics. Risk analysis results At the end of your risk analysis, you should have a list of risks, prioritized by danger level and likelihood. How to Mitigate Risk Once you fully understand the risks to your project, the next step is to mitigate those risks. To mitigate a risk means to limit negative effects as much as reasonably ","537 possible. You will rarely completely negate a risk. Rather, it’s like installing airbags into a car. The airbags won’t stop you from having a traffic accident. However, they will give you some protection if you have a collision with another vehicle at speed. Each of your risk mitigation strategies should either: ● Limit the chances of a negative event occurring, or ● Limit the effects of a negative event, if it occurs. Add at least one mitigation strategy to each risk. You might find that you can apply a single strategy to more than one risk – this is good! Action It’s all very well to have strategies to mitigate risk. But these are useless to you if you don’t follow through and do something. While you’ll be able to put some into place immediately, others will be contingency based. You won’t be able to enact these. However, you can clear the path to ensure that if you need to implement them, the process will be easy and smooth. Example Risk Analysis and Mitigation A construction company has a large CBD building project beginning soon. It needs to identify, analyze, and mitigate risks to the project. Identify The project team brainstorms and looks at similar past projects to gather a list of risks for the project. Analyze The team uses a feasibility study and risk assessment matrix to analyze and prioritize the risks that the project faces. It determines that the highest priority risk is that issues with shipping will cut supply lines and halt construction on the site. Mitigate While changing to a local supplier would eliminate that risk, it would also increase costs dramatically. The project team decides that the cost outweigh the benefit of eliminating the risk. However, it decides to make local suppliers an alternative option ","538 if the shipping issues actually occur. Getting a new supplier signed off requires quite a bit of paperwork and due diligence. If the problem hits, the team doesn’t want the project held up while this sign-off process happens. Instead, it starts the process at the beginning of the project, so that if it can’t get material from international suppliers, it can quickly and easily switch to the local suppliers instead. Note that this solution does not in any way change the potential event. The chances of international shipping disruption remain exactly the same. What the team has changed, though, is the negative impact that the event would have. The project might have higher costs, due to higher prices from local suppliers, but it shouldn’t experience a time delay. ","539 Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a tool that helps us anticipate what might go wrong with a product or process. We can also use it to identify the possible causes and probabilities of failures. What’s a Failure Mode? A failure mode is a chance for a process to go wrong. Or to look at it another way, it’s an opportunity for a defect or variation to occur in a product. Every process has potential weak spots. If we can recognize these in advance, we go a long way towards minimizing the damage caused. That’s why FMEA is such a handy tool. When to Use FMEA Perform a FMEA when you’re: ● Setting up a new process, before you start running it in a production environment. ● Improving an existing process. ● Changing an existing process – for example, modifying the type of material used. ● Looking for existing quality control (QC) issues within a process. The analysis can be of use in all of these situations. DMAIC Phases You can use a FMEA in the Analyze and Improve phases of a DMAIC project. Which will depend on the purpose of your project. If your project is aimed specifically at finding issues in an existing process, then you’ll perform the FMEA in the Analyze phase. This is to help you figure out where things are already going wrong. ","540 If your project has another aim – other process improvements, adding a new process – then the FMEA’s use is a bit different. Then, you’ll use it in the Improve phase to look for issues in your solution to the problem. You’re essentially double-checking yourself. Types of FMEA ● Design (DFMEA) A DFMEA focuses on a product or service. You’ll typically do these before you put a new product or service into manufacture, or when you change the design of either. When you perform one, you look at potential failures, safety issues, and regulatory concerns with the end product. Then you rank the severity of these. The next step is to find causes for those potential issues. Use a DFMEA to minimize the effects of product failure on your customers. By the end of your DFMEA, you should have strategies in place to correct all design issues identified. ● Process (PFMEA) A PFMEA looks at a process. Unlike a DFMEA, it looks at the end product or service only to find issues with a process that produced it. More commonly, you’ll look at the output from the process instead. Why are these two things different? Because most products and services are the result of multiple processes, not just one. For example, a digital camera has many parts, and each of these are produced using at least one process – often more. To find an issue with the shutter, for example, you’d look at processes that produce the shutter, and processes that fix the shutter into the camera. Start a PFMEA at or after the feasibility study, and before production begins. Typically, you’ll perform a PFMEA after the DFMEA, as the latter is focused on design, and the PFMEA is focused on how you bring the design to life. ● System (SFMEA) Also known as a functional FMEA (FFMEA). A system failure modes and effects analysis looks at the entire system on a high level. When you perform one, you look at things like the interrelationships between components and processes. An SFMEA ","541 can be useful because problems don’t just occur within processes or specific machines. They also occur between multiple processes or machines. Perform a SFMEA before the design phase where possible. This helps you to anticipate and work through issues that would otherwise affect your DFMEA. Inputs Your inputs for an FMEA typically come from people who know the process, product, service, or system very well. You’ll usually sit down and brainstorm potential failure points with these subject matter experts. Measurements During the FMEA process, you’ll need to provide three key scores: ● Severity: How large the consequences of a failure mode will be. Some effects could be catastrophic (think a nuclear power plant meltdown). Others might be very mild (for example, a slight variation in product weight). ● Occurrence: How likely the failure mode is to occur. Some failures might be very likely – for example, a laptop computer overheating outdoors in summer in Texas. Others might be very unlikely – for example, the nuclear power plant meltdown mentioned in the previous list item. ● Detection: How capable the current processes are to detect the failure. If this failure mode occurs, will the responsible person know about it straight away? These all use a scale from 1 to 10. You’ll note that these are somewhat subjective – you can’t simply use a tool to measure any of them. If you find that your team has trouble reaching consensus on the scores, try taking individual scores and calculating the mean score for each. Note: Some people use a scale of 1-5 instead. As long as you’re consistent, the scale you use isn’t too important. ","542 Outputs The main output from an FMEA is a Risk Priority Number (RPN) for each failure mode. The RPN is an objective measure of the priority for fixing any one failure mode or failure mode effect. The bigger the RPN, the higher the priority. The formula for calculating an RPN is: RPN = Severity * Occurrence * Detection How to Create a FMEA The first step in creating a failure modes and effects analysis is to understand what exactly you’re trying to achieve. We’ve listed the basic types of FMEA above; read through these and decide on what type of analysis you’ll be performing and what the end result should be. Before starting the FMEA Your preliminary work will depend on the type of analysis you’re planning to perform. Essentially, you need to ensure that the whole team understands what you’re analyzing so that you can brainstorm potential failure modes. PFMEA: Map your process. Draw a flowchart so that you have a visual representation of the entire process. DFMEA: List the attributes of your product or service. What it does, its measurements (services can have these too!), parts, etc. SFMEA: Map the components of your system. An interrelationship diagram might assist. Writing your FMEA 1. Get your team together and brainstorm possible failure points in your process, product, service, or system. 2. For each possible failure point, list the effects that failure could have. ","543 3. Draw up a blank table with columns for: ● Process step ● Potential failure mode ● Potential effects of failure ● Cause of failure ● Severity ● Occurrence ● Detection ● RPN 4. Enter the steps from your flowchart into the Process step column. Leave a few rows between each. 5. Add failure points for each step into the Potential failure mode column. Leave a couple of rows between each. 6. Enter the effects each failure could have into the Potential effects of failure column. 7. For each effect: 1. Add a cause. 2. Enter a score for the scale of the consequences of the effect in the Severity column. 3. Enter a score for the likelihood of the effect in the Occurrence column. 4. Add a score for the probability of detection of the failure effect in the Detection column. 5. Calculate the RPN for the effect by multiplying the effect’s Severity, Occurrence and Detection scores. Enter this number in the RPN column. Your next steps So you’ve created your FMEA document. Your job doesn’t finish there. Next, look at ways that your team can modify the product, service, system, or process to decrease RPN scores. It would be overly simplistic for this article to suggest always working on the highest scored (hence, highest priority) failure modes first. However, that can be done in a vacuum. Other sort orders are possible. For example, ASQ recommends “The team should use their experience and judgment to determine appropriate priorities for action.” (source) Once you’ve lowered the risks of failure modes as much as is feasible, add two more ","544 columns to the FMEA: ● Recommended action ● Responsibility. Then: 1. Add at least one recommended action. This is a process that should be followed if the potential failure effect actually occurs. 2. Enter the name or job of the person who will be responsible for carrying out the recommended action(s). Example of Using a FMEA in a DMAIC Project A company is putting together a new customer support department. As part of that process, it’s developed a number of processes for various customer queries. The Level 2 support team needs to complete a design FMEA for one of its processes. Preliminaries The team’s process analyst puts together a flowchart of the process. It shows the team five high-level steps in the process: 1. Get details from Level 1 support team. 2. Ask customers to run a diagnostic test and email the results. 3. Analyze results to find any issues. 4. Explain analysis to customers. 5. Fix problems if it’s within Level 2 abilities. If not, refer up to Level 3 support team. Constructing the blank FMEA The team lead uses Excel to create a spreadsheet for the FMEA. ","545 Adding process steps They add the five high-level process steps to the FMEA table. Brainstorming failure modes The team sit down together with the incomplete FMEA table. They talk about the process steps and brainstorm things that could go wrong at each. Once they’ve talked through all options, they enter the agreed failure modes. ","546 Recording potential effects The team records effects of each failure mode, sticking to objective measures that affect KPIs. Finding causes While some situations might require a tree diagram or other tool to chart potential causes, the team decides that this situation doesn’t need anything too complex. They record causes where the issue would reasonably originate in the customer service teams. ","547 Scoring The team use a simple discussion method to score Severity, Occurrence and Detection for each failure effect. Then, they calculate the RPN for each by multiplying the three scores. Prioritizing The team sort the spreadsheet from highest to lowest RPN. ","548 Next steps Now that the team has a prioritized list of failure modes, it can get to work on mitigating them. Beginning at the top of the list, they’ll work on ways to decrease the RPN: by making the failure less severe or less likely to occur. Making it harder to detect, on the other hand, isn’t generally recommended. Once the team has decreased the RPNs for its FMEA as much as it can, it adds a basic response plan for each failure mode. ","549 Fault Tree Analysis Fault tree analysis (FTA) is a graphical tool to explore the causes of system level failures. It uses boolean logic to combine a series of lower level events and it is basically a top-down approach to identify the component level failures (basic event) that cause the system level failure (top event) to occur. Fault tree analysis consists of two elements “events” and “logic gates” which connect the events to identify the cause of the top undesired event. Fault tree analysis is an easier method than the Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) as it focuses on all possible system failures of an undesired top event. Whereas FMEA conducts analysis to find all possible system failure modes irrespective of their severity. History of Fault Tree Analysis Fault tree analysis is a top down approach that was originally developed in Bell ","550 laboratories by H Waston and A Mearns for the air force in 1962. This concept was later adopted by Boeing and today it is widely used in aerospace, automobile, chemical, nuclear and software industries especially reliability and safety related events. When Would You Use FTA Fault tree analysis can be used to perform for all types of system level risk assessment process. The purpose of FTA is to effectively identify the cause(s) of system failure and mitigate the risks before it occurs. This is an invaluable tool for complex systems that visually displays the logical way of identifying the problem. Moreover system efficiency can be attained by this analysis. It can be implemented alone or complement to Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). FTA Symbols Fault tree uses logical gates to perform the analysis. There are numerous FTA symbols, but these are broadly divided into two categories, Event symbols and Gate symbols. Event Symbols in FTA Gate Symbols in FTA ","551 How do you do Fault Tree Analysis ● Define the primary failure to be analyzed in other words identify the undesirable top event ● Identify first level contributors which are just below the top level using the available technical information ● Link these contributors to top level event by using logical gates (AND, OR gates), and also see the relationship, so that it will help to identify the appropriate logical gate ● Identify the second level contributors and link to top by using logical gates. ● Identify minimal cut set ● Repeat the same steps till the basic causes ● Finally complete and evaluate the FTA ● Calculate probability of lowest level elements occurrence and also measure the probabilities from bottom up ","552 Minimal Cut Sets One of the important factors in qualitative analysis of fault trees is to identify minimal cut sets. For instance complex and large fault trees have to use superior tools (algorithms for extraction) to get the minimal cut sets. Cut set: A set of basic events that together cause the TOP undesirable event. Ex: X, Y and Z (from the below picture) Minimal cut set: A cut set with minimal number of events that can still cause the TOP undesirable event. In other words the TOP undesirable event occurs if one or more minimal cut set occurs. Ex: (X and Y); (X and Z) from the below picture ","553 Practical Example of FTA A fire broke out at unit 1 of XYZ cable manufacturing company despite the safety system in-place. The General Manager was very concerned about the accident and requested safety in-charge to evaluate the system. However as part of initial analysis of the existing system, the safety team used FTA to identify the different causes for accidents. ","554 Quantitative Fault Tree Analysis Top undesirable event occurs if one or more of the minimal cut set occurs, hence the main target is to identify minimal cut sets. Moreover if all the minimal cuts are independent to each other, then we could compute the probability of top undesirable event by: Where Pj is the failure probability of minimal cut set Example: Find the probability of water pump failure from the below example ","555 The water pump will fail because of value failure and value closed or fault indicator or light fail or control command fail or operator unable to open valve. Since OR gates add and AND gates multiply the probability of pump failure μpumpfail =1-(0.05*0.05)*(1-0.003)*(1-0.002)*(1-0.018)*(1-0.02) = 0.0448 Hence, the probability of water pump failure = 4.48% Advantages of Fault tree analysis ● Fault tree visually depict the analysis that will help team to work on cause of event in logical way that leads to failure ● Highlights the critical components related to system failure ● Provides an efficient method to analyze the system ● Unlike other analysis methods, human errors are also include in the analysis ● It helps to prioritize the action items to solve the problem ● Provides qualitative and quantitative analysis Disadvantages of Fault tree analysis ● Too many gates and events to be consider for large system analysis ● The basic disadvantage is that it examine only one top event ● Common cause failures are not always obvious ● Difficult to capture time related and other delay factors ● Needs experienced individuals to understand the logical gates ","556 Enterprise risk management (ERM) & Key Factors Enterprise risk management (ERM), a framework for managing risk across an organization, improves an organization’s ability to accept the right amount of risk to capture strategic opportunities. ERM is made up of eight components, each of which can be supported by the tools and methods of Six Sigma. ● Internal Environment The business vision, coupled with leadership’s personal examples, determines the values of the organization and the behaviors of its workers. This organizational culture establishes employees’ receptivity to change. Equal attention must be focused on the people's side of change, as well as the tactical tools of process change. The behaviors, attributes, ethical values and integrity of the process workers all contribute to their perceptions regarding risk and controls. Likewise, their view of their level of authority and responsibility – along with organizational commitment to human capital development – all have an effect on commitment levels and compliance risk management. Using Six Sigma change management tools can aid in creating this type of culture that looks at process improvement in a positive light. ● Objective Setting Enterprise objectives are established at the strategic level and translated into granular objectives at the business unit level. Traditionally, these objectives have been financial ones, which has led to behaviors that optimize performance of the business unit at the expense of the enterprise, both from the financial and risk perspectives. A trend in process improvement is emerging, however, in which organizations directly link these objectives to the voice of the customer (VOC), voice of the business (VOB) and voice of the regulator (VOR), providing a more realistic measure of organizational performance. ","557 An ERM framework has three broad categories of related objectives aligned with and supporting the selected strategy of the enterprise: Operational objectives relate to the effectiveness and efficiency of the enterprise’s operations. They have historically been financial in nature and have not been truly indicative of the waste that typically occurs within the organization. Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between the output indicators, those that the market may use to compare an organization to its competitors, to the process indicators that more accurately predict the performance capabilities of the processes. An organization’s ability to monitor and measure the upstream activities that contribute to the variability of its products or services can differentiate it from its competitors, which may continue to rely on outcome measures or financial measures to gauge their performance. Reporting objectives have been in the headlines recently with both internal and external reporting failures – excellent examples of the breakdowns that exist in ERM. These failures can be directly related to the internal environment component of risk management. Employees are often rewarded for their contributions toward the financial success of their business unit. Unfortunately, their actions may have an adverse effect on the overall enterprise. Six Sigma tools coupled with stakeholder adoption and change management can shift the focus to the VOC and the voice of the process (VOP). ","558 There are several different opportunities to increase the value of the organization through top-line growth (Figure 2) Compliance objectives rely on individual adherence to relative laws and regulations; however, employees’ behaviors can again be influenced by the internal environment established by leadership, coupled with the rewards and recognition system that drives those behaviors. The entity’s compliance record can significantly contribute to its reputation risk, either positively or negatively, in the marketplace. ● Event Identification Many basic Six Sigma tools can significantly assist leadership in managing this component of ERM. Using the tools can help practitioners: ➢ Provide insight into sources of potential failure events. ➢ Help determine opportunities to gather metrics that serve as both leading and lagging indicators. ➢ Apply statistical techniques to determine process capabilities that help establish escalation or threshold triggers. ➢ Highlight constraints that restrict the organization’s ability to meet production demand. ","559 ➢ Identify quality or service deficiencies. Functional process flow analysis is used in most Six Sigma projects to document the as-is process. By applying Lean principles, processes are streamlined to eliminate waste and inefficiencies. Performance metrics are established to indicate how well processes perform against the critical requirements of both the customer and the business. Process capability metrics and performance capability metrics serve as common measuring devices that leadership can use to prioritize resources to improve performance. However, performance metrics are lagging indicators that measure outputs as seen by the customers of the process. Statistical tools can help quantify the relationship of process and input indicators collected upstream, which predict the performance of the process. These leading indicators can be statistically correlated to the output metrics, thus used as upstream predictors of process performance. Process measures also provide an excellent source of information for identifying trends and root causes. Practitioners can use statistical techniques, such as hypothesis testing and design of experiments, to identify and quantify sources of variation in processes, and highlight the need for additional monitoring and controls in certain areas., These statistical techniques rely on the existence and accuracy of loss event data. Unfortunately, many organizations only recently have realized the need to establish these data repositories. Furthermore, tracking loss event data may not be enough. Organizations also must report rework and scrap. Once an organization has established a reliable collection of process metrics, statistical tools can be used to quantify and establish critical escalation or threshold triggers that prompt management to either quickly assess or respond to a potential area of concern before it becomes an event. Buffer zones can be defined and alerts automated to be proactive in preventing an adverse event (Figure 3). ","560 ● Risk Assessment Conducting a risk assessment is an opportunity to evaluate the magnitude that potential events might have on an organization’s ability to achieve both its strategic and operational objectives. There are three Six Sigma tools that can be used to translate the historically qualitative approach to more quantitative methods. Cause-and-effect matrix helps identify critical steps in a process and the presence, or absence, of controls that prevent, mitigate or monitor adverse events. Numerical scores determine which activities create the greatest risk. Inputs into the process are then scored to refine the areas of potential risk. Risk matrix can be used to score the enterprise’s ability to recognize sources of risk and its willingness and abilities to manage those risks. Twelve statements regarding risk are numerically scored to identify areas on which to focus, and opportunities to emphasize and leverage areas of strength. Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) helps evaluate the risk associated with steps in a process or with the steps in the implementation plan of any project. Potential failure modes and their potential resulting effects are identified and scored for severity of impact to the organization. Potential causes are then identified and scored based on frequency or likelihood of occurrence. Finally, present controls are identified and scored based on the organization’s ability to prevent, mitigate or ","561 detect these failure modes. The three scores are then multiplied together to create a risk priority number (RPN). ● Risk Response Once the RPN has been calculated, the FMEA requires that an action plan be developed and responsibilities assigned to reduce the risk associated with the critical areas identified. Based on the RPN and the risk tolerance established by the organization, business decisions can be made to avoid or prevent the risk, reduce or mitigate the risk, share the risk, or accept the risk. A formal cost/benefit analysis of these alternatives assists leadership in defining their response. Once the action plan has been completed, a recalculation of the RPN is performed to determine if the activity now falls within the risk tolerance or if additional actions are needed. ● Control Activities Once processes have been improved, new processes created or potential risk levels decreased, these gains must be sustained. The concept of a process owner, supported by a formal process control system, is embedded in Six Sigma. This process owner is responsible for the constant monitoring of the output, process and input metrics to ensure the process does not return to its formal state. Control activities, such as policies and procedures, activity management, data integrity, and information processing all ensure leadership’s risk responses are performed with minimal variation and reported accurately. A process control system contains all the information required to monitor the performance of critical processes. New process maps are used to educate all process workers regarding their role in the process and how their performance relates to the work of others. Critical performance targets are documented and continuously updated. Performance metrics are collected and compared to those performance targets to monitor process performance. At this stage, statistical tools help evaluate the control activities. Quantifying the relationship of different data sets enhances the process owner’s ability to predict uncertainty. Control charts provide real-time monitoring of both common cause variation and timely evidence of special cause variation requiring immediate management intervention. Finally, hypothesis testing supports the investigation of unexpected results or unusual circumstances. ","562 ● Monitoring An enterprise’s approach to risk management changes over time. What was once viewed as compliance eventually becomes just good leadership practices. Critical core processes that once crossed multiple functional areas, but lacked both ownership and accountability, are now monitored and managed by process owners who listen to both the ever-changing VOC and VOB to evaluate performance continuously. Six Sigma consolidates multiple process control systems into a framework so process owners can constantly monitor and report key output, input and process metrics that more accurately reflect the enterprise’s performance. ● Information and Communication With a process management system to capture information quickly and report it accurately, process owners can focus less on the internal politics that exist between functional silos, and more on improving customer satisfaction and shareholder value. Data that is routinely collected as part of the process control system can be aggregated at the process, business unit and ultimately the enterprise level to provide the basis for management to make better informed and more timely decisions. Simple tools, such as balanced scorecards or risk dashboards, communicate a clear and concise message to all employees: Achieving objectives and managing risk are equally important. Actions to take/ Do’s ● Gain support of top management and the board ● Engage a broad base of managers and employees in the process ● Start with a few key risks and build ERM incrementally ● Use existing knowledge, skills and resources in management, internal audit, compliance etc. ● Embed ERM into the fabric of the organization ● Take a holistic, portfolio view of risks across the enterprise Actions to Avoid / Don'ts ● Gain support of top management and the board ● Engage a broad base of managers and employees in the process ● Start with a few key risks and build ERM incrementally ","563 ● Use existing knowledge, skills and resources in management, internal audit, compliance etc. ● Embed ERM into the fabric of the organization ● Take a holistic, portfolio view of risks across the enterprise ● Never treat ERM as a project – ERM is a process ● Don’t get bogged down in details and history – ERM should be strategic and forward-looking ● Avoid relying only on a few key staff – make ERM everyone’s job ● Don’t take a silo or stove-pipe approach to risks. Don’t ignore how risks might impact on other parts of the business ● Avoid obsessing too much about categorizing risks – rather than ensuring that the key risks have been identified and mitigation plans developed ● Never assume that the risk register is complete – there will always be ‘unknown unknowns’ and the biggest enemy of effective ERM is complacency ","564 CHAPTER 8: ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS METHODS ","565 Gap Analysis Gap Analysis is an assessment tool we use in Six Sigma. In it, we compare an organization’s current performance to its desired or potential performance. Steps in a Gap Analysis The basic steps that you’ll need to follow are: ● Look at the existing situation. ● Figure out the situation you want to be in. ● What is the gap? ● Why is there a gap between these two situations? ● What metrics can you use to measure this gap? ● How can you overcome this gap? ● Come up with a list of resources you need and how they can help fill the gap. Gap Analysis Metrics There are all sorts of metrics that you can use for gap analysis. The metrics that you choose are crucial to getting good results. Use metrics that are: ● Measurable: For example, annual income and outgoings are two measurable metrics commonly used in gap analyses. There are lots more, though. Public opinion, production statistics, and market share are just a few examples. ● Meaningful: The metrics that you use should be instrumental in bridging the gap. For example, if your organization’s main issue is negative public opinion, income is not a meaningful metric. Metrics like social media sentiment score ","566 are meaningful in this context. ● Improvable: If you can’t improve it, why bother tracking it? Use metrics that you can affect. For example, a company that catches snakes for people in suburbia is likely to experience a slump in business over winter. Using ‘number of call outs’ as a metric might not provide many options for change, whereas ‘percentage of market share’ would. ● Complementary: Sometimes using a single metric will leave out a lot of the picture. For example, imagine that you focus solely on customer satisfaction. Your customer satisfaction is steadily rising, but the number of customers is sharply dropping off. The overall situation is bad, but using only a single metric makes it look good. Using customer retention rate as a complementary metric would help deliver a more realistic understanding of the situation. Gap Analysis Example A not for profit organization is running a street kitchen. It’s serving 200 meals a day to underprivileged people in the neighborhood. However, demand is exceeding supply. The organization is constantly turning people away without meals. A group forms to figure out a solution. It decides that a gap analysis would be useful. 1. Existing situation The organization is currently serving 100 breakfasts and 100 lunches every weekday. 2. Ideal situation The group does some research about the area. This organization is the only one operating in the area to offer meals. There are approximately 1000 people living nearby who struggle to obtain nutritious meals every day. 3. Calculating the gap Not every family would need meals every day. The group estimates that 500 breakfasts and lunches per day would adequately meet the current need. That would mean increasing the number of meals served by 400%. ","567 4. Understanding the gap The group assumed that lack of supplies would be the primary issue. On investigation, though, it turns out this isn’t quite the case. While the organization doesn’t currently receive enough funding for five times the amount of food, the main issues seem to be around planning and wastage. Lots of food is going cold and therefore inedible. The Time between cooking and serving are high. Cooks are used to family cooking and often struggle to keep up with the high throughput needed. 5. Metrics Obviously, the number of meals served per day is an important metric. But after looking at the gap, the group decides to use food wastage percentage and preparation to serving times as well. 6. Resources The group is out of its depth, as none of its members are professional caterers. So it contacts a few local eateries to ask for assistance in developing a plan of action. 7. Filling the gap The group meets with industry professionals to get ideas on how to improve its key metrics. Brainstorming delivers a few workable options. The group votes and comes up with a shortlist: ● Offer more cold options like muffins and fruit. This decreases wastage due to bacteria growth. ● Switch to less complicated meals. This decreases prep time. ● Use production lines. This decreases prep and serving times. The group estimates that this will increase the number of meals served to 300 per meal. This gets the organization halfway to its target of 500 per meal. ","568 Root Cause Analysis Root cause analysis (RCA) is a process for identifying the root causes of problems and a systematic approach for responding to them. Root cause analysis is based on the idea that effective management should find a way to prevent problems before they occur and affect the work of an entire organization. Root cause analysis is one of the most crucial problem-solving elements in quality management. Root cause analysis is an important part of Six Sigma methodology, as it is a key component of the analyze phase of DMAIC – define, measure, analyze, improve, control. There are six major tools of root cause analysis, which are used through the process of identifying the root causes of a problem. ● Pareto Chart ● The 5 Whys ● Scatter Plot Diagram ● Fishbone Diagram ● Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) ● Fault Tree Analysis Pareto Chart A Pareto chart is a type of chart that contains both bars and a line graph, where individual values are represented in descending order by bars, and the cumulative total is represented by the line. The chart is named for the Pareto principle, which, in turn, derives its name from Vilfredo Pareto, a noted Italian economist. The left vertical axis is the frequency of occurrence, but it can alternatively represent cost or another important unit of measure. The right vertical axis is the cumulative percentage of the total number of occurrences, total cost, or total of the particular unit of measure. ","569 Because the values are in decreasing order, the cumulative function is a concave function. To take the example below, in order to lower the amount of late arrivals by 78%, it is sufficient to solve the first three issues. The purpose of the Pareto chart is to highlight the most important among a (typically large) set of factors. In quality control, Pareto charts are useful to find the defects to prioritize in order to observe the greatest overall improvement. It often represents the most common sources of defects, the highest occurring type of defect, or the most frequent reasons for customer complaints, and so on. Wilkinson (2006) devised an algorithm for producing statistically based acceptance limits (similar to confidence intervals) for each bar in the Pareto chart. These charts can be generated by simple spreadsheet programs, specialized statistical software tools, and online quality charts generators. The Pareto chart is one of the seven basic tools of quality control. Pareto principle The Pareto principle states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes (the \"vital few\"). Other names for this principle are the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity. Management consultant Joseph M. Juran developed the concept in the context of quality control, and improvement, naming it after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who noted the 80/20 connection while at the University of Lausanne in 1896. In his first work, Cours d'économie politique, Pareto showed that approximately 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population. The Pareto principle is only tangentially related to Pareto efficiency. Mathematically, the 80/20 rule is roughly described by a power law distribution (also known as a Pareto distribution) for a particular set of parameters, and many natural phenomena have been shown to exhibit such a distribution. It is an adage of business management that \"80% of sales come from 20% of clients\" ","570 WHEN TO USE A PARETO CHART ● When analyzing data about the frequency of problems or causes in a process ● When there are many problems or causes and you want to focus on the most significant ● When analyzing broad causes by looking at their specific components ● When communicating with others about your data PARETO CHART PROCEDURE 1. Decide what categories you will use to group items. 2. Decide what measurement is appropriate. Common measurements are frequency, quantity, cost and time. 3. Decide what period of time the Pareto chart will cover: One work cycle? One full day? A week? 4. Collect the data, recording the category each time, or assemble data that already exists. ","571 5. Subtotal the measurements for each category. 6. Determine the appropriate scale for the measurements you have collected. The maximum value will be the largest subtotal from step 5. (If you do optional steps 8 and 9 below, the maximum value will be the sum of all subtotals from step 5.) Mark the scale on the left side of the chart. 7. Construct and label bars for each category. Place the tallest at the far left, then the next tallest to its right, and so on. If there are many categories with small measurements, they can be grouped as “other.” ○ Note: Steps 8 and 9 are optional but are useful for analysis and communication. 8. Calculate the percentage for each category: the subtotal for that category divided by the total for all categories. Draw a right vertical axis and label it with percentages. Be sure the two scales match. For example, the left measurement that corresponds to one-half should be exactly opposite 50% on the right scale. 9. Calculate and draw cumulative sums: add the subtotals for the first and second categories, and place a dot above the second bar indicating that sum. To that sum add the subtotal for the third category, and place a dot above the third bar for that new sum. Continue the process for all the bars. Connect the dots, starting at the top of the first bar. The last dot should reach 100% on the right scale. ","572 5 Whys Unpredicted problems may occur in any team or process. However, problems are just symptoms of deeper issues. Fixing a problem quickly may be a convenient solution, however, it doesn’t protect your work process from recurring mistakes. This is why your team needs to focus on finding the root cause and tackle it properly. The 5 Whys technique is one of the most effective tools for root cause analysis in the Lean management arsenal. Every team faces roadblocks in its daily work. However, using the 5 Whys will help you find the root cause of any problem and protect the process from recurring mistakes and failures. Origin of 5 Whys The 5 Whys method is part of the Toyota Production System. Developed by Sakichi Toyoda, a Japanese inventor and industrialist, the technique became an integral part of the Lean philosophy. “The basis of Toyota’s scientific approach is to ask why five times whenever we find a problem … By repeating why five times, the nature of the problem as well as its solution becomes clear.“ Taiichi Ohno One of the key factors for successful implementation of the technique is to make an informed decision. This means that the decision-making process should be based on an insightful understanding of what is actually happening on the work floor. In other words, the root cause analysis process should include people with practical experience. Logically, they can give you the most valuable information regarding any problem that appears in their area of expertise. ","573 5 Whys Analysis in Action When applying the 5 Whys technique, you want to get to the problem's essence and then fix it. Actually, the 5 Whys may show you that the source of the problem is quite unexpected. Often, issues that are considered a technical problem actually turn out to be human and process problems. This is why finding and eliminating the root cause is crucial if you want to avoid iteration of failures. ","574 Here is an example of applying the 5 Whys. Problem – We didn’t send the newsletter for the latest software updates on time. ● Why didn’t we send the newsletter on time? Updates were not implemented until the deadline. ● Why were the updates not implemented on time? Because the developers were still working on the new features. ● Why were the developers still working on the new features? One of the new developers didn’t know the procedures. ● Why was the new developer unfamiliar with all procedures? He was not trained properly. ● Why was he not trained properly? Because CTO believes that new employees don’t need thorough training and they should learn while working. ","575 You can notice that the root cause of the initial problem turned out to be something completely different from most expectations. Furthermore, it is obvious that it is not technological but a process problem. This is typical because we often focus on the product part of the problem as we neglect the human factor. Therefore, the 5 Whys analysis aims to inspect a certain problem in depth until it shows you the real cause. Keep in mind that “5” is just a number. Ask “Why” as many times as you need to complete the process and take appropriate actions. How to Get Started with 5 Whys The 5 Whys technique may help you achieve continuous improvement at any level of your organization. Here are some basic steps you need to follow. ● Form a team Try to assemble a team of people from different departments. Each representative has to be familiar with the process that is going to be investigated. By forming a cross-functional team, you are going to receive unique points of view. This will help you collect enough information to make an informed decision. Be aware that this is not an individual task, and it needs to be executed by the team. ● Define the problem Discuss the problem with the team and make a clear problem statement. It will help you define the scope of the issue you are going to investigate. This is important because investigating a wide scope problem may be a time- consuming exercise with blurred boundaries. Try to be as focused as possible to find an effective solution in the end. ● Ask Why ","576 Empower one person to facilitate the whole process. This team leader will ask the questions and try to keep the team focused. The answers should be based on facts and real data, rather than on emotional opinions. The facilitator should ask “Why” as many times as needed until the team can identify the root cause of the initial problem. Advice 1. Don’t ask too many Whys. If you keep going, you may end up receiving tons of unreasonable suggestions and complaints, which is not the purpose. Focus on finding the root cause. Advice 2. Sometimes there could be more than one root cause. In these cases, the 5 Whys analysis will look more like a matrix with different branches. This may even help you detect and eliminate organizational issues that have permanent negative effects on the overall performance. Take Action After the team detects the root cause(s), it is time to take corrective actions. All members should be involved in a discussion to find and apply the best solution that will protect your process from recurring problems. When the decision is made, one of the team members should be responsible for applying the right actions and observing the whole process. After a certain period of time, the team needs to meet again and check if their actions actually had a positive impact. If not, the process should be repeated. In the end, the case should be documented and sent across the organization. Sharing this information will give an insightful overview of different kinds of problems a team may face and how those problems can be eliminated. ","577 ● Each bar usually represents a type of defect or problem. The height of the bar represents any important unit of measure — often the frequency of occurrence or cost. ● The bars are presented in descending order (from tallest to shortest). Therefore, you can see which defects are more frequent at a glance. ● The line represents the cumulative percentage of defects. Let’s look at the table of data for the Pareto Chart above to understand what cumulative percentage is. ","578 A3 Problem-Solving: Fight the Root Cause A great part of our daily work routine is actually related to solving problems. Either small or big, problems are an inevitable part of our workday. However, if you decide to act fast and remove a problem as swiftly as possible, you may face the same issue repeatedly. Instead of fighting only the symptoms, you need to dig deeper and discover the root cause. By doing so, you will be able to protect the work process from recurring problems. This is where the A3 methodology comes into play. Implementing an A3 problem-solving tool is a bright example of how problems should be treated to be eliminated efficiently. Based on some simple steps and ideas, the model gives directions on dealing with problem-solving issues through simple structuring, good collaboration, and active communication. What is A3 Thinking? First of all, let’s briefly touch upon the mindset that A3 thinking aims to develop. It can be summarized in 7 elements: ● Logical Thinking – A3 represents a step-based thinking process. ● Objectively presenting information – there are no hidden agendas here. ● Results and Processes – sharing what end results were achieved as well as the means of achieving them. ● Sharing only essential information and putting it into a visual format whenever possible. ● Whatever actions are taken, they must be aligned with the company’s strategy and objectives. ● The focus is on developing a consistent perspective that can be adapted across the entire organization. ● Developing a structured approach to problem-solving. ","579 Origin of the A3 Problem-Solving Tool The A3 report is one of the many Lean management tools developed as part of the Toyota Production System (TPS). There isn’t a single inventor of the A3 reporting method. In fact, Isao Kato (former manager at Toyota) describes it as a hybrid between the PDCA cycle and Toyota’s philosophy to make things visible. There is also a legend that Taiichi Ohno often refused to read further than the first page of any written report. This is why the A3 is a one-page report. The name A3 comes from the European A3 paper size corresponding to 11-inches by 17-inches or 29.7cm x 42cm. A3 thinking played a major role in Toyota’s commercial success. Consequently, it became a widespread tool, now used in various industries. Let’s explore the A3 problem-solving tool in detail. Foundations of the A3 model Actually, A3 is just a single report that will not help you solve problems like a magic wand. It is much more important for all involved parties to be dedicated to the process and communicate actively. Before you begin with the formation of your own A3 reporting method, you need to be familiar that there are 3 major roles in the process: ● Owner ● Responders ● Mentor/coach The owner is responsible for managing the process and maintaining the document. On the other hand, the owner needs to be advised and supervised by a mentor experienced in problem-solving. ","580 The mentor’s role is to give directions and provoke the problem owner to find the solution, but not to give answers and propositions. Last but not least, there are responders or stakeholders. They are the third party, which is directly interested in the final results of the A3 project. Here is the challenge. Usually, there is a wide variety of stakeholders involved. The problem owner needs to have access to all of them if needed. However, we all know that it is a bit difficult to reach higher management in organizations with a strict hierarchy. This is why the whole organization should be familiar with the concept of lean thinking and be prepared to assist at any time. Sometimes this is challenging, but it can show how flexible an organization really is. At the end of the day, the active communication between all parties involved is crucial for the success of any A3 project. The A3 Report The A3 report is a single-page document, which reflects the results of the whole process. Usually, it contains seven steps, but it may also have other variations. Below you can find an A3 report example, which most often will include the following steps: ● Background/Clarify the problem ● Current situation ● Set targets/goals ● Root cause analysis ● Countermeasures ● Implementation ● Effect confirmation/Follow-up ","581 The A3 Process The A3 methodology is a lean thinking process where the problem owner should go through the model's different steps until there is a proper solution to be implemented. The owner needs to communicate actively with his colleagues and the mentor of the project. Let’s now examine the different steps that comprise the A3 process. Background First of all, you need to clarify the problem and briefly describe it. This is a starting point where the owner can add context and support the next steps. Current situation Before a problem can be addressed properly, the problem owner needs to describe the current situation in the area where the issue appears. At this stage, you can map the different processes that exist around the problem area. It will allow you to see the bigger picture and identify the root cause. Set targets/goals After the current situation is clear, you need to set goals. Keep in mind that at this stage, you need to take into consideration that you don’t have the full picture. So after you go through the remaining steps until “effect confirmation,” you can come back to this step and add more details to the initial goals. ","582 Root cause analysis This is a significant step from the successful implementation of the A3 process. Trying to fight the problem immediately means that you are only treating the symptoms while leaving the root cause untouched. This way, a problem may appear regularly in bigger proportions. Therefore, once you have a good understanding of how the processes work and the initial goal, you need to figure out the root cause of the problem. For this purpose, you can use different techniques such as the 5 whys. Countermeasures Once you are familiar with the root cause, you may start offering solutions. From here, you can go back to the initial goal and add more details. In all cases, the countermeasures should lead to a clear understanding of how the initial goal will be achieved. Implementation Plan After setting the countermeasures, you have to present an implementation plan that includes a list of the actions that will be applied to get the countermeasures in place. It is also helpful to assign responsible individuals for each task and a due date. Effect confirmation & Follow-up The last step is crucial for establishing a culture of continuous improvement. It is imperative to measure the actual results and confirm the effect of your countermeasures. Whether there are positive or negative results, you need to take action. If the actual results differ from the predicted ones, you should modify the plan, re- ","583 implement it, and follow-up.If there is a positive effect, you should communicate improvements to the rest of the organization and ultimately make them a standard. Benefits of A3 problem-solving The A3 model is consistent, and it encourages mentoring and overall collaboration. Furthermore, it promotes the cross-organizational sharing of information and encourages learning and continuous improvement on every organizational level. Also, the A3 methodology encourages commitment to common goals and strengthens the levels of responsibility. Last but not least, you can use an A3 report not only for problem-solving but also for proposing improvements, reporting, coaching, and others. ","584 (無駄)Muda: Seven Classic Wastes, (斑 )Mura & (無理)Muri The Toyota Production System, and later on the concept of Lean, was developed around eliminating the three types of deviations that show inefficient allocation of resources. The three types are Muda (無駄, waste), Mura (斑, unevenness), and Muri ( 無理, overburden) (無駄)Muda: Seven Classic Wastes Lean manufacturing, a management philosophy primarily derived from the Toyota Production System, focuses on eliminating waste—called “Muda”— within a manufacturing system. It takes into account many kinds of waste, including the waste of excessive human motion, and aims to integrate each step of production into a holistic, efficient process that reduces cost and improves overall revenue. Under the lean manufacturing system, seven wastes are identified: overproduction, inventory, motion, defects, over- processing, waiting, and transport. ","585 ● Overproduction The most serious of the wastes, overproduction can cause all other types of wastes and results in excess inventory. Stocking too much of a product that goes unused has obvious costs: storage, wasted materials, and excessive capital tied up in useless inventory. Depending, of course, on the product in question, overproduction can have very serious environmental effects. More raw materials than necessary are consumed; the product may spoil or become obsolete, which requires that it be tossed; and, if the product involves hazardous materials, more hazardous materials than necessary are wasted, resulting in extra emissions, extra costs of waste disposal, possible worker exposure, and potential environmental problems resulting from the waste itself. ● Inventory Inventory waste refers to the waste produced by unprocessed inventory. This includes the waste of storage, the waste of capital tied up in unprocessed inventory, the waste of transporting the inventory, the containers used to hold inventory, the ","586 lighting of the storage space, etc. Moreover, having excess inventory can hide the original wastes of producing said inventory. The environmental impacts of inventory waste are packaging, deterioration or damage to work-in-process, additional materials to replace damaged or obsolete inventory, and the energy to light—as well as either heat or cool—inventory space. ● Motion Wasteful motion is all of the motion, whether by a person or a machine, that could be minimized. If excess motion is used to add value that could have been added by less, then that margin of motion is wasted. Motion could refer to anything from a worker bending over to pick something up on the factory floor to additional wear and tear on machines, resulting in capital depreciation that must be replaced. There are many environmental costs from excess motion. One obvious one is the needless waste of materials used to replace worn machines; another one could be the health resources for overburdened employees, who might not have needed them if motion had been minimized. ● Defects Defects refer to a product deviating from the standards of its design or from the customer’s expectation. Defective products must be replaced; they require paperwork and human labor to process it; they might potentially lose customers; the resources put into the defective product are wasted because the product is not used. Moreover, a defective product implies waste at other levels that may have led to the defect to begin with; making a more efficient production system reduces defects and increases the resources needed to address them in the first place. Environmental costs of defects are the raw materials consumed, the defective parts of the product requiring disposal or recycling (which wastes other resources involved in repurposing it), and the extra space required and increased energy use involved in dealing with the defects. ● Over-processing Over-processing refers to any component of the process of manufacture that is unnecessary. Painting an area that will never be seen or adding features that will not be used are examples of over-processing. Essentially, it refers to adding more value than the customer requires. ","587 The environmental impact involves the excess of parts, labor, and raw materials consumed in production. Time, energy, and emissions are wasted when they are used to produce something that is unnecessary in a product; simplification and efficiency reduce these wastes and benefit the company and the environment. ● Waiting Waiting refers to wasted time because of slowed or halted production in one step of the production chain while a previous step is completed. To take the classic example, the production line, if one task along the chain takes longer than another, than any time the employee in charge of the next task spends waiting is wasted. The task that takes more time must be made more efficient, other employees must be hired to help, or the workflow must be better coordinated or scheduled in order to make up for this wasted time. The environmental impact comes from the wasted labor and energy from lighting, heating, or cooling during the waiting period. Additionally, material can be spoiled, and components could be damaged because of an inefficient workflow. ● Transport Transport is moving materials from one position to another. The transport itself adds no value to the product, so minimizing these costs is essential. This means having one plant closer to another in the production chain, or minimizing the costs of transportation using more efficient methods. Resources and time are used in handling material, employing staff to operate transportation, training, implement safety precautions, and using extra space. Transport can also cause the waste of waiting, as one part of the production chain must wait for material to arrive. Environmental costs to wait include gas emissions, transportation packaging used, possible damage to the product en route, as well as a whole host of other wastes involving transporting hazardous materials. ","588 Mura (斑) Mura means unevenness, non-uniformity, and irregularity. Mura is the reason for the existence of any of the seven wastes. In other words, Mura drives and leads to Muda. For example, in a manufacturing line, products need to pass through several workstations during the assembly process. When the capacity of one station is greater than the other stations, you will see an accumulation of waste in the form of overproduction, waiting, etc. The goal of a Lean production system is to level out the workload so that there is no unevenness or waste accumulation. Mura can be avoided through the Just-In-Time ‘Kanban’ systems and other pull-based strategies that limit overproduction and excess inventory. The key concept of a Just-In-Time system is delivering and producing the right part, at the right amount, and at the right time. ","589 Muri (無理) Muri means overburden, beyond one’s power, excessiveness, impossible or unreasonableness. Muri can result from Mura and in some cases be caused by excessive removal of Muda (waste) from the process. Muri also exists when machines or operators are utilized for more than 100% capability to complete a task or in an unsustainable way. Muri over a period of time can result in employee absenteeism, illness, and breakdowns of machines. Standardized work can help avoid Muri by designing the work processes to evenly distribute the workload and not overburden any particular employee or equipment. Relationship between Muda, Mura and Muri Muda, Mura, and Muri are interrelated. Eliminating one of them will affect the other two. For example, a firm that needs to transport 6 tons of materials to a customer has several options (Lean Enterprise Institute, 2016). ","590 The first option is to load one truck with all 6 tons and make a single trip. However in this example, it would be considered Muri due to the overburden of the truck. This excess load can lead to a breakdown. The second option is to divide the transportation into two trips. One with two tons and the other with four tons. This would be considered Mura since the unevenness of the arrival of materials to the customer can lead to problems at the receiving dock. In the first trip, the delivery may be too little for the production necessary on-site. In the second trip, the amount of delivered material may be too much for on-site storage and material handling. This leads to Muri since one of the trucks is overburdened and the receiver is also overburdened for that delivery. Additionally, Muda can be seen from the uneven workload. This can cause employees who receive the materials to wait around. The third option is to load two tons on each truck and make three trips. Even though this option has no Mura and Muri, it has Muda since the truck would not be fully loaded on each trip. Each truck can carry up to 3 tons of material and this option makes one unnecessary trip. The fourth option is to deliver the materials with two trucks each with 3 tons. In this example, this would be the optimal level that minimizes Muda, Mura, and Muri. Muda does not exist because the trucks are carrying the loads at their maximum capacity. There is no excess capacity nor unnecessary trips with this strategy. Mura does not exist because the workload between the two deliveries are uniform. As a ","591 result, there is no unevenness. And finally, Muri is absent from this option because both the truck and the operators are not working beyond their capacity. In real world applications of Lean, it is not always easy or possible to find an optimal solution. Reducing Muda can lead to Muri. The existence of Mura can be seen as a waste in Muda. And finally Muri can lead to a breakdown in the system that will result in a large amount of Muda and Mura. Since real world problems are dynamic and the needs of customers are always changing, our work processes must also change as well. As we design our processes and standardize our work, we must look at the resulting system from the lens of these three concepts. Only by considering the impacts of Muda, Mura, and Muri and optimizing our production strategy can we develop an efficient Lean system. ","592 The 8th Waste of Lean – Underutilized Skills and Talent Most of us are familiar with the seven wastes in Lean. But often we hear of an additional eighth waste – Underutilized Skills and Talent. What contributes to it, and how can we improve? Finally, in an April 2019 article: The Eighth Waste: Non-utilized Talent, the authors M. Brito, A.L. Ramos, P. Carneiro, and M. A. Goncalves highlight the eighth waste and its components. Respondents to the researchers’ survey (production workers, managers and executives), answered that the eighth waste is related to the lack of one or more than one of the following components: rewards, recognition, justice, evaluation, motivation, goals, self-esteem, knowledge, and resources. Rewards: “The reward system may play a role in increasing employees’ motivation to work more effectively, increase productivity within the company or compensate for the lack of commitment, if a reward is related to employee’s performance.” Recognition: “ …recognition increases ensuing performance substantially, and particularly when recognition is exclusively provided to the best performer.” Justice: “The employees need a system of pay and promotion policies that they understand to be fair, unambiguous, and in line with their expectations.” Evaluation and Feedback: “Performance evaluation is described as comparing the performance of workers and the work standards, and managing the necessary activities in a systematic way to attain these standards.” Motivation: “…positive relationship between intrinsic motivation, job satisfaction, and job performance.” Goals: “Goals with feedback generally increase worker satisfaction and productivity.” Self-esteem: “The effects of personnel management policies, which emphasize job ","593 satisfaction, could potentially lead to developments in levels of health, happiness, subjective well-being and workers’ self-esteem, all of which are factors that can improve organizational performance.” Training and Knowledge: “Training programs are helpful for companies to emphasize the knowledge, expertise and ability of workers.” Resources: “One of the reasons why the workers do not use their full talent is that the organization did not provide them with the necessary resources to develop the work in an optimized way.” ","594 CHAPTER 8: LEAN MANUFACTURING METHODS ","595 Lean manufacturing is a production method aimed primarily at reducing times within the production system as well as response times from suppliers and to customers. It is derived from Toyota's 1930 operating model \"The Toyota Way\" (Toyota Production System, TPS).The term \"Lean\" was coined in 1988 by John Krafcik in his article \"Triumph of the Lean Production System\", and defined in 1996 by James Womack and Daniel Jones to consist of five key principles: ● Precisely specify value by specific product, ● identify the value stream for each product, ● make value flow without interruptions, ● let customer pull value from the producer, ● and pursue perfection.\" Companies employ the strategy to increase efficiency. By receiving goods only as they need them for the production process, it reduces inventory costs and wastage, and increases productivity and profit. The downside is that it requires producers to forecast demand accurately as the benefits can be nullified by minor delays in the supply chain. It may also impact negatively on workers due to added stress and inflexible conditions. A successful operation depends on a company having regular outputs, high-quality processes, and reliable suppliers. History Fredrick Taylor and Henry Ford documented their observations relating to these topics, and Shigeo Shingo and Taiichi Ohno applied their enhanced thoughts on the subject at Toyota in the 1930s. The resulting methods were researched from the mid- 20th century and dubbed \"Lean\" by John Krafcik in 1988, and then were defined in The Machine that Changed the World[4][page needed] and further detailed by James Womack and Daniel Jones in Lean Thinking (1996). Evolution in Japan The exact reasons for adoption of JIT in Japan are unclear, but it has been suggested it started with a requirement to solve the lack of standardization. Plenert offers four reasons, paraphrased here. During Japan's post–World War II rebuilding of industry: ","596 1. Japan's lack of cash made it difficult for industry to finance the big-batch, large inventory production methods common elsewhere 2. Japan lacked space to build big factories loaded with inventory. 3. The Japanese islands lack natural resources with which to build products. 4. Japan had high unemployment, which meant that labor efficiency methods were not an obvious pathway to industrial success. Thus, the Japanese \"leaned out\" their processes. \"They built smaller factories ... in which the only materials housed in the factory were those on which work was currently being done. In this way, inventory levels were kept low, investment in in-process inventories was at a minimum, and the investment in purchased natural resources was quickly turned around so that additional materials were purchased.\" Plenert goes on to explain Toyota's key role in developing this lean or JIT production methodology. Continuous production improvement and incentives for such were documented in Taylor's Principles of Scientific Management (1911): \"... whenever a workman proposes an improvement, it should be the policy of the management to make a careful analysis of the new method, and if necessary conduct a series of experiments to determine accurately the relative merit of the new suggestion and of the old standard. And whenever the new method is found to be markedly superior to the old, it should be adopted as the standard for the whole establishment.\" \"...after a workman has had the price per piece of the work he is doing lowered two or three times as a result of his having worked harder and increased his output, he is likely entirely to lose sight of his employer's side of the case and become imbued with a grim determination to have no more cuts if soldiering [marking time, just doing what he is told] can prevent it.\" Shigeo Shingo cites reading Principles of Scientific Management in 1931 and being \"greatly impressed to make the study and practice of scientific management his life's work\"., ","597 Shingo and Taiichi Ohno were key to the design of Toyota's manufacturing process. Previously a textile company, Toyota moved into building automobiles in 1934. Kiichiro Toyoda, founder of Toyota Motor Corporation, directed the engine casting work and discovered many problems in their manufacturing, with wasted resources on repair of poor-quality castings. Toyota engaged in intense study of each stage of the process. In 1936, when Toyota won its first truck contract with the Japanese government, the processes encountered new problems, to which Toyota responded by developing \"Kaizen\" improvement teams, into what has become the Toyota Production System (TPS), and subsequently The Toyota Way. Levels of demand in the postwar economy of Japan were low; as a result, the focus of mass production on lowest cost per item via economies of scale had little application. Having visited and seen supermarkets in the United States, Ohno recognised that scheduling of work should not be driven by sales or production targets but by actual sales. Given the financial situation during this period, over- production had to be avoided, and thus the notion of \"pull\" (or \"build-to-order\" rather than target-driven \"push\") came to underpin production scheduling. Evolution in the rest of the world Just-in-time manufacturing was introduced in Australia in the 1950s by the British Motor Corporation (Australia) at its Victoria Park plant in Sydney, from where the idea later migrated to Toyota.[9] News about JIT/TPS reached other western countries from Japan in 1977 in two English-language articles: one referred to the methodology as the \"Ohno system\", after Taiichi Ohno, who was instrumental in its development within Toyota. The other article, by Toyota authors in an international journal, provided additional details. Finally, those and other publicity were translated into implementations, beginning in 1980 and then quickly multiplying throughout industry in the United States and other developed countries. A seminal 1980 event was a conference in Detroit at Ford World Headquarters co-sponsored by the Repetitive Manufacturing Group (RMG), which had been founded 1979 within the American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS) to seek advances in manufacturing. The principal speaker, ","598 Fujio Cho (later, president of Toyota Motor Corp.), in explaining the Toyota system, stirred up the audience, and led to the RMG's shifting gears from things like automation to JIT/TPS. At least some of the audience's stirring had to do with a perceived clash between the new JIT regime and manufacturing resource planning (MRP II), a computer software-based system of manufacturing planning and control which had become prominent in industry in the 1960s and 1970s. Debates in professional meetings on JIT vs. MRP II were followed by published articles, one of them titled, \"The Rise and Fall of Just-in-Time\".Less confrontational was Walt Goddard's, \"Kanban Versus MRP II—Which Is Best for You?\" in 1982. Four years later, Goddard had answered his own question with a book advocating JIT. Among the best known of MRP II's advocates was George Plossl, who authored two articles questioning JIT's kanban planning method[16] and the \"japanning of America\". But, as with Goddard, Plossl later wrote that \"JIT is a concept whose time has come\". By 1986, a case-study book on JIT in the U.S. was able to devote a full chapter to ZIPS at Omark, along with two chapters on JIT at several Hewlett-Packard plants, and single chapters for Harley-Davidson, John Deere, IBM-Raleigh, North Carolina, and California-based Apple Inc., a Toyota truck-bed plant, and New United Motor Manufacturing joint venture between Toyota and General Motors. Rebranding as \"lean\" John Krafcik coined the term \"Lean\" in his 1988 article, \"Triumph of the Lean Production System\". The article states: ● (a) Lean manufacturing plants have higher levels of productivity/quality than non-Lean and ● (b) \"The level of plant technology seems to have little effect on operating performance\" (page 51). According to the article, risks with implementing Lean can be reduced by: \"developing a well-trained, flexible workforce, product designs that are easy to build with high quality, and a supportive, high-performance supplier network\". ","599 Methodology The strategic elements of lean can be quite complex, and comprise multiple elements. Four different notions of lean have been identified: ● Lean as a fixed state or goal (being lean) ● Lean as a continuous change process (becoming lean) ● Lean as a set of tools or methods (doing lean/toolbox lean) ● Lean as a philosophy (lean thinking) The other way to avoid market risk and control the supply efficiently is to cut down on stock. P&G has completed their goal to cooperate with Walmart and other wholesales companies by building the response system of stocks directly to the suppliers' companies. In 1999, Spear and Bowen identified four rules which characterize the \"Toyota DNA\": All work shall be highly specified as to content, sequence, timing, and outcome. Every customer-supplier connection must be direct, and there must be an unambiguous yes or no way to send requests and receive responses. The pathway for every product and service must be simple and direct. Any improvement must be made in accordance with the scientific method, under the guidance of a teacher, at the lowest possible level in the organization. This is a fundamentally different approach from most improvement methodologies, and requires more persistence than basic application of the tools, which may partially account for its lack of popularity. The implementation of \"smooth flow\" exposes quality problems that already existed, and waste reduction then happens as a natural consequence, a system-wide perspective rather focusing directly upon the wasteful practices themselves. Sepheri provides a list of methodologies of JIT manufacturing that \"are important but not exhaustive\": ● Housekeeping: physical organization and discipline. ","600 ● Make it right the first time: elimination of defects. ● Setup reduction: flexible changeover approaches. ● Lot sizes of one: the ultimate lot size and flexibility. ● Uniform plant load: leveling as a control mechanism. ● Balanced flow: organizing flow scheduling throughput. ● Skill diversification: multi-functional workers. ● Control by visibility: communication media for activity. ● Preventive maintenance: flawless running, no defects. ● Fitness for use: producibility, design for process. ● Compact plant layout: product-oriented design. ● Streamlining movements: smoothing materials handling. ● Supplier networks: extensions of the factory. ● Worker involvement: small group improvement activities. ● Cellular manufacturing: production methods for flow. ● Pull system: signal [kanban] replenishment/resupply systems. Key principles and waste Womack and Jones define Lean as \"...a way to do more and more with less and less—less human effort, less equipment, less time, and less space—while coming closer and closer to providing customers exactly what they want\" and then translate this into five key principles: ● Value: Specify the value desired by the customer. \"Form a team for each product to stick with that product during its entire production cycle\", \"Enter into a dialogue with the customer\" (e.g. Voice of the customer) ● The Value Stream: Identify the value stream for each product providing that value and challenge all of the wasted steps (generally nine out of ten) currently necessary to provide it ● Flow: Make the product flow continuously through the remaining value- added steps ● Pull: Introduce pull between all steps where continuous flow is possible ● Perfection: Manage toward perfection so that the number of steps and the amount of time and information needed to serve the customer continually falls Lean is founded on the concept of continuous and incremental improvements on product and process while eliminating redundant activities. \"The value of adding activities are simply only those things the customer is willing to pay for, everything ","601 else is waste, and should be eliminated, simplified, reduced, or integrated\". On principle 2, waste, see seven basic waste types under The Toyota Way. Additional waste types are: ● Faulty goods (manufacturing of goods or services that do not meet customer demand or specifications, Womack et al., 2003. See Lean services) ● Waste of skills (Six Sigma) ● Under-utilizing capabilities (Six Sigma) ● Delegating tasks with inadequate training (Six Sigma) ● Metrics (working to the wrong metrics or no metrics) (Mika Geoffrey, 1999) ● Participation (not utilizing workers by not allowing them to contribute ideas and suggestions and be part of Participative Management) (Mika Geoffrey, 1999) ● Computers (improper use of computers: not having the proper software, training on use and time spent surfing, playing games or just wasting time) (Mika Geoffrey, 1999) Implementation One paper suggests that an organization implementing Lean needs its own Lean plan as developed by the \"Lean Leadership\". This should enable Lean teams to provide suggestions for their managers who then make the actual decisions about what to implement. Coaching is recommended when an organization starts off with Lean to impart knowledge and skills to shop-floor staff. Improvement metrics are required for informed decision-making. Lean philosophy and culture is as important as tools and methodologies. Management should not decide on solutions without understanding the true problem by consulting shop floor personnel. The solution to a specific problem for a specific company may not have generalised application. The solution must fit the problem. Value-stream mapping (VSM) and 5S are the most common approaches companies take on their first steps to Lean. Lean can be focused on specific processes, or cover the entire supply chain. Front-line workers should be involved in VSM activities. Implementing a series of small improvements incrementally along the supply chain can bring forth enhanced productivity. ","602 Naming Alternative terms for JIT manufacturing have been used. Motorola's choice was short-cycle manufacturing (SCM). IBM's was continuous-flow manufacturing (CFM), and demand-flow manufacturing (DFM), a term handed down from consultant John Constanza at his Institute of Technology in Colorado. Still another alternative was mentioned by Goddard, who said that \"Toyota Production System is often mistakenly referred to as the ' Kanban System'\", and pointed out that kanban is but one element of TPS, as well as JIT production. Objectives and benefits Objectives and benefits of JIT manufacturing may be stated in two primary ways: first, in specific and quantitative terms, via published case studies; second, general listings and discussion. A case-study summary from Daman Products in 1999 lists the following benefits: reduced cycle times 97%, setup times 50%, lead times from 4 to 8 weeks to 5 to 10 days, flow distance 90%. This was achieved via four focused (cellular) factories, pull scheduling, kanban, visual management, and employee empowerment.[59] Another study from NCR (Dundee, Scotland) in 1998, a producer of make-to-order automated teller machines, includes some of the same benefits while also focusing on JIT purchasing: In switching to JIT over a weekend in 1998, eliminated buffer inventories, reducing inventory from 47 days to 5 days, flow time from 15 days to 2 days, with 60% of purchased parts arriving JIT and 77% going dock to line, and suppliers reduced from 480 to 165. Hewlett-Packard, one of western industry's earliest JIT implementers, provides a set of four case studies from four H-P divisions during the mid-1980s.[61] The four divisions, Greeley, Fort Collins, Computer Systems, and Vancouver, employed some but not all of the same measures. At the time about half of H-P's 52 divisions had adopted JIT. ","603 Criticism This article's Criticism or Controversy section may compromise the article's neutral point of view of the subject. Please integrate the section's contents into the article as a whole, or rewrite the material. (June 2021) According to Williams, it becomes necessary to find suppliers that are close by or can supply materials quickly with limited advance notice. When ordering small quantities of materials, suppliers' minimum order policies may pose a problem, though. Employees are at risk of precarious work when employed by factories that utilize just-in-time and flexible production techniques. A longitudinal study of US workers since 1970 indicates employers seeking to easily adjust their workforce in response to supply and demand conditions respond by creating more nonstandard work arrangements, such as contracting and temporary work. Natural and man-made disasters will disrupt the flow of energy, goods and services. The down-stream customers of those goods and services will, in turn, not be able to produce their product or render their service because they were counting on incoming deliveries \"just in time\" and so have little or no inventory to work with. The disruption to the economic system will cascade to some degree depending on the nature and severity of the original disaster.[70][71] The larger the disaster the worse the effect on just-in-time failures. Electrical power is the ultimate example of just-in- time delivery. A severe geomagnetic storm could disrupt electrical power delivery for hours to years, locally or even globally. Lack of supplies on hand to repair the electrical system would have catastrophic effects. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption in JIT practices, with various quarantine restrictions on international trade and commercial activity in general interrupting supply while lacking stockpiles to handle the disruption; along with increased demand for medical supplies like personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators, and even panic buying, including of various domestically manufactured (and so less vulnerable products) like panic buying of toilet paper, disturbing regular demand. This has led to suggestions that stockpiles and diversification of suppliers should be more heavily focused. Critics of Lean argue that this management method has significant drawbacks, ","604 especially for the employees of companies operating under Lean. Common criticism of Lean is that it fails to take in consideration the employee's safety and well-being. Lean manufacturing is associated with an increased level of stress among employees, who have a small margin of error in their work environment which require perfection. Lean also over-focuses on cutting waste, which may lead management to cut sectors of the company that are not essential to the company's short-term productivity but are nevertheless important to the company's legacy. Lean also over-focuses on the present, which hinders a company's plans for the future. Critics also make negative comparisons of Lean and 19th century scientific management, which had been fought by the labor movement and was considered obsolete by the 1930s. Finally, lean is criticized for lacking a standard methodology: \"Lean is more a culture than a method, and there is no standard lean production model.\" After years of success of Toyota's Lean Production, the consolidation of supply chain networks has brought Toyota to the position of being the world's biggest carmaker in rapid expansion. In 2010, the crisis of safety-related problems in Toyota made other carmakers that duplicated Toyota's supply chain system wary that the same recall issue might happen to them. James Womack had warned Toyota that cooperating with single outsourced suppliers might bring unexpected problems.[78] Lean manufacturing is different from lean enterprise. Recent research reports the existence of several lean manufacturing processes but of few lean enterprises.[79] One distinguishing feature opposes lean accounting and standard cost accounting. For standard cost accounting, SKUs are difficult to grasp. SKUs include too much hypothesis and variance, i.e., SKUs hold too much indeterminacy. Manufacturing may want to consider moving away from traditional accounting and adopting lean accounting. In using lean accounting, one expected gain is activity-based cost visibility, i.e., measuring the direct and indirect costs at each step of an activity rather than traditional cost accounting that limits itself to labor and supplies Lean manufacturing is a methodology that focuses on minimizing waste within manufacturing systems while simultaneously maximizing productivity. Waste is seen as anything that customers do not believe adds value and are not willing to pay for. Some of the benefits of lean manufacturing can include reduced lead times, ","605 reduced operating costs and improved product quality. Lean manufacturing, also known as lean production, or lean, is a practice that organizations from numerous fields can enable. Some well-known companies that use lean include Toyota, Intel, John Deere and Nike. The approach is based on the Toyota Production System and is still used by that company, as well as myriad others. Companies that use enterprise resource planning (ERP) can also benefit from using a lean production system. Lean manufacturing is based on a number of specific principles, such as Kaizen, or continuous improvement. Lean manufacturing was introduced to the Western world via the 1990 publication of The Machine That Changed the World, which was based on an MIT study into the future of the automobile detailed by Toyota's lean production system. Since that time, lean principles have profoundly influenced manufacturing concepts throughout the world, as well as industries outside of manufacturing, including healthcare, software development and service industries. Five principles of lean manufacturing A widely referenced book, Lean Thinking: Banish Waste and Create Wealth in Your Corporation, which was published in 1996, laid out five principles of lean, which many in the field reference as core principles. They are value, the value stream, flow, pull and perfection. These are now used as the basis for lean implementation. 1. Identify value from the customer's perspective. Value is created by the producer, but it is defined by the customer. Companies need to understand the value the customer places on their products and services, which, in turn, can help them determine how much money the customer is willing to pay. The company must strive to eliminate waste and cost from its business processes so that the customer's optimal price can be achieved -- at the highest profit to the company. 2. Map the value stream. This principle involves recording and analyzing the flow of ","606 information or materials required to produce a specific product or service with the intent of identifying waste and methods of improvement. Value stream mapping encompasses the product's entire lifecycle, from raw materials through to disposal. Companies must examine each stage of the cycle for waste. Anything that does not add value must be eliminated. Lean thinking recommends supply chain alignment as part of this effort. 3. Create flow. Eliminate functional barriers and identify ways to improve lead time. This aids in ensuring the processes are smooth from the time an order is received through to delivery. Flow is critical to the elimination of waste. Lean manufacturing relies on preventing interruptions in the production process and enabling a harmonized and integrated set of processes in which activities move in a constant stream. 4. Establish a pull system. This means you only start new work when there is demand for it. Lean manufacturing uses a pull system instead of a push system. Push systems are used in manufacturing resource planning (MRP) systems. With a push system, inventory needs are determined in advance, and the product is manufactured to meet that forecast. However, forecasts are typically inaccurate, which can result in swings between too much inventory and not enough, as well as subsequent disrupted schedules and poor customer service. In contrast to MRP, lean manufacturing is based on a pull system in which nothing is bought or made until there is demand. Pull relies on flexibility and communication. 5. Pursue perfection with continual process improvement, or Kaizen. Lean manufacturing rests on the concept of continually striving for perfection, which entails targeting the root causes of quality issues and ferreting out and eliminating waste across the value stream. ","607 The eight wastes of lean production The Toyota Production System laid out seven wastes, or processes and resources, that don't add value for the customer. These seven wastes are: ● unnecessary transportation; ● excess inventory; ● unnecessary motion of people, equipment or machinery; ● waiting, whether it is people waiting for idle equipment; ● over-production of a product; ● over-processing or putting more time into a product than a customer needs, such as designs that require high-tech machinery for unnecessary features; and ● defects, which require effort and cost for corrections. Although not originally included in the Toyota Production System, many lean practitioners point to an eighth waste: waste of unused talent and ingenuity. Seven lean manufacturing tools and concepts Lean manufacturing requires a relentless pursuit of reducing anything that does not add value to a product, meaning waste. This makes continuous improvement, which lies at the heart of lean manufacturing, a must. Other important concepts and processes lean relies on include: Heijunka: production leveling or smoothing that seeks to produce a continuous flow of production, releasing work to the plant at the required rate and avoiding interruptions. 5S: A set of practices for organizing workspaces to create efficient, effective and safe areas for workers and which prevent wasted effort and time. 5S emphasizes organization and cleanliness. Kanban: a signal used to streamline processes and create just-in-time delivery. Signals can either be physical, such as a tag or empty bin, or electronically sent through a system. Jidoka: A method that defines an outline for detecting an abnormality, stopping ","608 work until it can be corrected, solving the problem, then investigating the root cause. Andon: A visual aid, such as a flashing light, that alerts workers to a problem. Poka-yoke: A mechanism that safeguards against human error, such as an indicator light that turns on if a necessary step was missed, a sign given when a bolt was tightened the correct number of times or a system that blocks a next step until all the previous steps are completed. Cycle time: How long it takes to produce a part or complete a process. Lean vs. Six Sigma Six Sigma is an approach to data-driven management, similar in nature to lean, which seeks to improve quality by measuring how many defects there are in a process and eliminating them until there are as little defects as possible. Both lean and Six Sigma seek to eliminate waste. However, the two use different approaches since they address the root cause of waste differently. In the simplest terms, where lean holds that waste is caused by additional steps, processes and features that a customer doesn't believe adds value and won't pay for, Six Sigma holds that waste results from process variation. Still, the two approaches are complementary and have been combined into a data-driven approach, called Lean Six Sigma. ","609 THE FIVE S'S (5S) OF LEAN 5S is a five step methodology for creating a more organized and productive workspace: Sort, Straighten, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain. 5S serves as a foundation for deploying more advanced lean production tools and processes. What is The 5S Methodology? 5S is often summarized by the philosophy “a place for everything and everything in its place.” You may have heard of “KonMari,” a home organization system propagated by Marie Kondo. The KonMari method transforms cluttered homes into tidy and simplified living spaces. The 5S principles are similar to KonMari. However, saying that 5S is just about tidying is like saying yoga is just about stretching. In other words, there is much more depth. So, let’s explore the true intent and meaning of 5S. 5S originated as 5 Japanese words: Seiri, Seiton, Seisou, Seiketsu, and Shitsuke. In English these have come to be known as: ● Sort: Eliminate that which is not needed. ● Straighten: Organize what remains after sorting. ● Shine: Clean and inspect the work area. ● Standardize: Write standards for 5S. ● Sustain: Consistently apply the 5S standards. At their core, 5S activities build the discipline needed for substantial and continuous improvement by creating (and sustaining) efficient and effective work areas. ","610 Why Is 5S Important in Manufacturing? While 5S was first developed in the context of the automotive industry, it is now widely considered an essential element of any lean manufacturing program, regardless of industry. Embedding 5S as part of daily life within your company means much more than improved organization, sustained cleaning routines, and efficient activity flows. By using the 5S methodology, operators are encouraged to improve their overall work environment and reduce muda or waste. Adherence to 5S standards is considered the foundation of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) and an integral part of the Toyota Production System (TPS). 5S also creates a stable platform from which Kaizen activities can be launched. The bottom line - 5S is a low investment, high impact lean manufacturing tool that is predicated on people. It engages operators in “owning” their workspace and helps to instill a culture of quality, productivity, and improvement. What are the Benefits of 5S Program? Key benefits of a 5S program include: ● Creating space within your facility by removing unnecessary tools and equipment ● Reducing waste from unnecessary motion by organizing the workspace ● Reducing down time and improving quality by consistently maintaining equipment ● Engaging operators by granting them more responsibility for their work environment ● Creating a safer work environment by ensuring it is clean and well- maintained Now that you have a better understanding of why 5S is important and how it can benefit your manufacturing operations, let’s learn more about each of the 5S steps. ","611 Sort/Seiri/整理/せいり What Is Sort? The Sort step separates items in your workspace that you know you need from those that you do not need or may not need by moving the latter to a “red tag” holding area. Sort: Separate and organize objects in your workplace between things you do and do not use Why Do You Need Sort? Sort enables you to have a more productive workspace by removing unneeded clutter (and eliminating distractions). It also is a first step towards opening up space that can be used for other things. How Do You Implement Sort? Separate necessary items (e.g., tools, parts, and materials) from unnecessary items. We recommend sorting items into four categories: ● Items needed in this work area. These are items you know that you regularly use in the context of this work area and thus will stay in this work area. ● Items needed in another work area. Essentially, these are misplaced items. If an item is used in another work area “sort” it into that area by delivering it to whomever is responsible for that work area. ● Items you may need. For items you are unsure about, use the 5S “red tag” system. Mark such items with red tags, which at a minimum should include the name of who tagged the item, why it is thought to no longer be needed, a ","612 proposed review date, and the name of the manager who must approve of disposal. Move the item to a red tag holding area, which should be organized by review month to make it easy to manage the area. ● Items you do not need. These are items that you are 100% confident are not needed. They should be immediately discarded. TIP: 5S can also be applied to your “digital workspace”. Delete obsolete computer files (sort) and place needed files in well-organized folders (straighten). What Are Some Examples of Sort? ● Remove waste (or muda) from your workspace. ● Discard broken or old parts using 5S red tags. ● Responsibly recycle materials and papers. ● Separate everyday tools from special-case tools. ● Avoid overfilling your workspace with excess materials. ● Create an overflow area outside of the workspace for duplicate materials, tools, and parts. Straighten / Seiton /整頓 What Is Straighten? The Straighten step thoroughly organizes the items that remain after sorting, such that frequently used items are easy to access and every item has a clear and easy-to- find home. Straighten: After clearing out objects you don't need, you can organize or straighten ","613 out what remains Why Do You Need to Straighten? Straighten enables every item to have a specific home where it can be easily found and to which it can be easily returned. It reduces the waste from excess motion as items are placed in more ergonomic locations. It is also the second step towards opening up space that can be used for other things. How Do You Implement Straighten? After you’ve sorted items, it’s time to decide how you want to organize them. We recommend the following methodology: ● Provide easy access to frequently used items. The key to reducing waste from excess motion is to place frequently used items within easy reach. ● Group like items. Group the remaining items into logical categories and brainstorm the best way to organize and store each of these categories. ● Visualize item homes. For each group, decide on the best way to make it clear when an item is missing or misplaced. A classic example is creating a shadow board for tools. ● Use containers. If it is appropriate for the type of item, consider organizing it within a container. ● Unleash the label. If an item is too big to put into a container, consider giving it a frame and putting a label on the item in addition to the frame. ● Be agile. Your initial straight pass will likely deliver a significant improvement - but you are also likely to overlook some potential improvements. Meet with your team after one week and again after two weeks to brainstorm further improvements as part of your initial implementation. TIP: Ask a coworker to find specific items in your work area. If they easily find the items, you’ve done a great job of straightening! If not, pay attention to where they looked first. Maybe that would be a better home for the item. What Are Some Examples of Straighten? ","614 ● Give every item a distinct “home.” ● Use color as a way of organizing and creating meaning. ● Separate everyday tools from special-case tools. ● Dedicate a surface or area entirely to shadow boxes and tool storage. ● Dedicate another surface or area entirely to working. Shine /Seiso/清掃 What Is Shine? The Shine step elevates the work area by thoroughly cleaning and inspecting tools, equipment, and other items. It also can include routine maintenance on equipment, which is one of the ways it flows directly into TPM. Shine: Clean your objects, workstation, and machinery - starting at the source Why Do You Need to Shine? Shine creates a work environment that engages and empowers operators by giving them more responsibility and agency over their work area. It also helps them to identify problems before they interfere with production. For example, in a clean work environment, it is much easier to spot emerging issues such as fluid leaks, material spills, metal shavings from unexpected wear, hairline cracks in mechanisms, etc. How Do You Implement Shine? After you’ve straightened items, it’s time to elevate the work area by cleaning, inspecting, and in some cases performing routine maintenance. We recommend the following: ","615 ● Grab the metaphorical spray bottle. Using appropriate cleaners and cleaning tools, make the work area sparkle. With every sweep, mop, brush, wipe, wash, and wax, strive to return your workspace to its former glory. Be Miyagi. ● Find the source. The guiding principle of this step is “clean to understand”. If there are any signs of leaks, spills, or unexpected debris, strive to understand the source. It is likely an early warning of a future problem. ● Inspect. After cleaning each item, take a moment to look it over and examine its condition. Does it need updating, maintenance or repair? TIP: One of the most important benefits of Shine is catching problems early and preventing unexpected breakdowns. What Are Some Examples of Shine? ● Wipe down equipment. ● Examine the wear of your tools. ● Disassemble larger objects to inspect the state of their parts. ● Investigate a recurring unclean spot or mess. ● Make sure to follow proper cleaning procedures to prevent damage to equipment. Standardize / Seiketsu /清潔 What Is Standardize? The Standardize step is a bridge between the first three steps (Sort, Straighten, Shine) and the last step (Sustain). In this step your goal is to capture best practices for 5S as standardized work for your team. Standardize: Creating a set of standards and 5S systems to help create clean habits ","616 Why Do You Need to Standardize? Standardize makes 5S repeatable. It transforms 5S from a one-off project to a reproducible set of activities. How Do You Implement Standardize? It’s time to make sure all your hard work continues to pay dividends into the future. Set expectations for the future with a documented 5S process. To do so, we recommend that you: ● Document in pairs. Have one team member walk through each task as another documents it to ensure nothing important is missed. ● Capture the essence. We are huge proponents of simplicity (and agile). Capture the essence of each task and no more. Otherwise your documentation will very likely not be maintained. ● Prefer checklists. Checklists feel easy. Short checklists feel even easier. A great format is to have a name for each task that serves as a quick reminder and a more detailed description for training. ● Organize to simplify. Organize your checklists by role, by shift, and by frequency (daily, weekly, monthly). This will make the 5S process much less intimidating to your team. TIP: Create checklists and for each task ask yourself whether it truly adds value. Simplicity is a virtue! What Are Some Examples of Standardize? ","617 ● Write down your 5S practices. ● Create “implementation” checklists and “audit” checklists. ● Create “kits” that contain the materials needed to perform a specific task. ● Use photos and other simple visuals as part of your training materials. ● Build a schedule for tasks. Sustain / Shitsuke /躾 What Is Sustain? The Sustain step assures that 5S is applied on an ongoing basis. It transforms your standardized 5S processes into regularly completed tasks. Sustain: Understand these changes are meant to improve the workplace, and can be adapted Why Do You Need to Sustain? Iterative 5S processes lock in your gains and ensure further and continued progress. How Do You Implement Sustain? Once you’ve standardized, it’s time to continually act upon those standards. We recommend you: ● Create a schedule. Embed 5S practices as scheduled tasks (by role, shift, and frequency). ● Teach through demonstration. Instruct employees on how to conduct 5S tasks through demonstration and training. Showing employees what is ","618 expected of them will prepare them to enact tasks on their own. ● Supervise to solo. After initial 5S training for employees, gently supervise while they continue to form habits. It is easy to make mistakes or fall off the wagon, so patiently and helpfully offer corrections when necessary. ● Adapt as necessary. When giving or receiving feedback on tasks, see where changes can be made to make the tasks easier and more efficient. Standardized work is intended to be living documentation. TIP: Continuous improvement is driven by continuous feedback. Solicit ideas and approach each suggestion with genuine curiosity and a desire to learn. What Are Some Examples of Sustain? ● Hold a demonstration meeting to explain complex or multi-step processes. ● Perform periodic check-ins after initial training. ● Teach employees to run 5S audits. ● Respond to mistakes with additional training. ● Encourage supervisors and operators to communicate openly and constructively to find ways to improve your 5S implementation. ● Set quarterly audit reminders for reviewing the red tag holding area. ","619 Poka Yoke (ポカヨケ) Poka-yoke (ポカヨケ, [poka joke]) is a Japanese term that means \"mistake-proofing\" or \"inadvertent error prevention\". A poka-yoke is any mechanism in a process that helps an equipment operator avoid (yokeru) mistakes (poka) and defects by preventing, correcting, or drawing attention to human errors as they occur. The concept was formalized, and the term adopted, by Shigeo Shingo as part of the Toyota Production System. Meaning and Birth of Poka-Yoke The term Poka-Yoke (poh-kah yoh-keh) was coined in Japan during the 1960s by Shigeo Shingo, an industrial engineer at Toyota. Shingo also created and formalized Zero Quality Control – a combination of Poka-Yoke techniques to correct possible defects and source inspection to prevent defects. ","620 Actually, the initial term was baka-yoke, meaning ‘fool-proofing’, but was later changed because of the term’s dishonorable and offensive connotation. Poka-Yoke means ‘mistake-proofing’ or more literally – avoiding (yokeru) inadvertent errors (poka). Poka-Yoke ensures that the right conditions exist before a process step is executed, thus preventing defects from occurring in the first place. Where this is not possible, Poka-Yoke performs a detective function, eliminating defects in the process as early as possible. Poka-Yoke is any mechanism in a Lean manufacturing process that helps to avoid mistakes. Its purpose is to eliminate product defects by preventing, correcting, or drawing attention to human errors as they occur. Examples of Poka-Yoke Application In a broader sense, it is also a behavior-shaping constraint as a process step to prevent incorrect operation. One of the most common is when a car driver with a manual gearbox must press on the clutch pedal (a process step – Poka-Yoke) before starting the engine. The interlock prevents an unintended movement of the car. Another example is a car with an automatic transmission, which has a switch that requires the vehicle to be in “Park” or “Neutral” before it can be started. These serve as behavior-shaping constraints as there are actions that must be performed before the car is allowed to start. This way, over time, the driver’s behavior is adjusted to the requirements by repetition and habit. ","621 Child proof socket Other examples can be found in the child-proof electric sockets or the washing machine that does not start if the door is not closed properly to prevent flooding. These types of automation don’t allow mistakes or incorrect operation from the start. The flexibility of Poka-Yoke allows for it not to be costly. For example, Toyota’s goal is to implement each mistake- proofing device for under $150. Depending on the size of the company, it can be an extremely cost-efficient endeavor. When and How to Use it? Poka-Yoke technique could be used whenever a mistake could occur, or something could be done wrong – meaning everywhere. It can be successfully applied to any type of process in the manufacturing or services industry, preventing all kinds of errors: ● Processing error: Process operation missed or not performed per the standard operating procedure. ● Setup error: Using the wrong tooling or setting machine adjustments incorrectly. ● Missing part: Not all parts are included in the assembly, welding, or other processes. ● Improper part/item: Wrong part used in the process. ● Operations error: Carrying out an operation incorrectly; having the incorrect version of the specification. ● Measurement error: Errors in machine adjustment, test measurement, or dimensions of a part coming in from a supplier. ","622 The six principles of poka-yoke To reduce the prevalence of process errors, poka-yoke is based on six principles in decreasing order of effectiveness. ● Elimination – the most preferable solution. It involves redesigning a product or process so that a particular step is no longer necessary. ● Prevention – or engineering a product or service so that it is virtually impossible for an individual to make a mistake. ● Replacement – can a more reliable process be substituted in to lessen the chances of an error occurring? ● Facilitation – or the adoption of techniques to make a task easier to perform. This may involve combining certain steps. ● Detection – or identifying an error before further process steps are undertaken. This allows the error to be rectified without further damage to equipment or personnel. ● Mitigation – the least preferable solution. Here, the aim is to minimize the effects of errors without necessarily solving them. Poka-yoke error detection methods To detect and prevent errors or mistakes, there are three different methods: ● Fixed value method Ideal for operations where the same process is repeated many times over. The fixed value method utilizes automatic counters and sensory devices to control the number of moves, the length of movement, and other crucial manufacturing parameters. ● Motion step method The motion step method is used for any process requiring a single worker to carry out different activities in one process. Primarily, the motion step method ensures the worker does not omit an important step or add a step that is not a part of the standard procedure. ","623 ● Contact method A broad set of methods that detect errors in shape, dimension, position, or any other physical trait via direct contact with the product itself. The contact method is useful in manufacturing characterized by intense repetition or in facilities where production is infrequent. For example, a winery that operates a bottling production line for only a few weeks each year. On that note, the method can also be used to detect errors resulting from dust, temperature, noise, and improper lighting. A simple poka-yoke procedure Poka-yoke is simple to implement because it is a rational approach that can be applied in almost any situation. Consider the following step-by-step process: 1. Start by identifying the operation or process. Consult a flowchart if possible and review process steps where errors are likely to occur. 2. For each of the errors identified, work backward to discover its source in the process. Some use the 5 Whys method to assist in this step. 3. Then, the team must brainstorm ideas that will make it impossible for the error to occur. Return to the six principles of poka-yoke and remember that elimination, prevention, and replacement are the most desirable courses of action. 4. If it is deemed impossible or economically unviable to prevent the error from occurring, the team should think of ways to minimize its effects. There are two options here. The first is setting functions, which are methods used to inspect process parameters or product attributes for errors. The second option is regulatory functions, which are alerts such as bells, buzzers, or lights that let workers know an error has occurred. 5. With the above in mind, it is time to choose, test, and implement the most suitable prevention method for each error. Most businesses can collect rapid feedback by three different inspection methods. The first is a simple inspection that is performed at the next step in the process by another worker. Feedback may also be gathered via self-inspection, where the worker verifies their own work immediately after it has been performed. The third and final inspection method involves source inspection checks. These are carried ","624 out before the step takes place to ensure conditions are correct. Benefits of poka-yoke principles for businesses Error prevention is an obvious advantage to poka-yoke, but what positive ramifications does error prevention have for a business? ● Improved profitability Errors on production lines decrease profitability – whether that be through line shutdowns or expensive worker injuries. But poka-yoke principles improve a company’s bottom line in other ways. For example, hotels now require that guests insert their key-card into a slot to activate electricity in their room. Since many guests do not bother to turn the lights off after they leave, the hotel can save money on wasted electricity consumption. ● Improved productivity Preventing errors before they occur increases productivity. Online forms require that every field be filled out before submission. This reduces errors in forms resulting from incomplete or missing information, saving the company time and money in having to chase up consumers for the extra details. ATMs also chime or flash to remind the customer to retrieve their debit card and cash. This greatly reduces the once common error of customers leaving their cards in the machine. It also saves the bank money in loss prevention, giving customer support the resources to deal with other problems. ● Simplification of smaller, error-prone tasks Small tasks with a high probability of error are particularly prevalent in some industries such as the service and hospitality industries. Cashier errors in counting change, for example, are relatively inconsequential errors in isolation that have the potential to lose a business a lot of money over the long term. To this end, poka-yoke principles have automated the change counting process and where automation is not possible, digital interfaces verify that the cashier has given the correct amount of change. Similar systems are now in place to prevent errors in order fulfillment and delivery of orders to a table ","625 Reduce Cycle Time You’ve probably reached what you thought was the limit of how far your cycle times could be reduced. And when that happens, you start to wonder if there’s something else to be done so that you can deliver to the customer faster and quit feeling like you’re treading water just to stay afloat. Six steps for reducing cycle times: ● Properly measure on-time delivery ● Understand cycle time vs lead time ● Reduce cycle time ● Optimize the order of your processes ● Leverage your scheduling flexibility for profit ● Continue to improve cycle time and lead time 1. Properly measure on-time delivery On-time delivery as a metric is a key performance indicator for most manufacturing and logistics operations. It is so significant because it is essentially keeping a promise to the customer, who trusts a business to stick to the delivery date they give the customer. It is tempting to measure this metric in such a way that makes it look better on paper than it is in reality. You have to be honest about how well you are meeting customer expectations. Specifically, you should be measuring on-time delivery by the order, not by the unit. Imagine a customer receiving only 80% of the matching plates they ordered for a big party. Do you think they will buy from the company who shipped an incomplete order again? On paper, this looks like an 80% on-time delivery rate if you measure it by the unit, but to the customer this was not truly an on-time delivery. They feel like it was a 0% on-time delivery rate, because they didn’t end up with a full matching set and had to break out the paper plates. ","626 You should also aim for the timeline the customer actually wants, not just what you expect is possible based on how you currently operate. Don’t limit yourself by accepting that you’ve already reached the best you can do. Maybe you’ve figured out how to deliver when you said you would, but can you deliver it faster, when the customer really wants it? Obviously, “as soon as possible” is what people want most of the time, but there is a lot of room between the standard lead time and what is actually possible with continual improvements like the ones we suggest in this article. 2. Understand cycle time vs lead time It is important to understand the difference between cycle time and lead time and know how they interact with each other. Cycle time is how long it will take you to produce the units you need. Lead time is how long it will take to process an order and get it to the customer. If you can reduce your cycle time, then you will have more time within your usual lead time. That gives you room to rearrange your processes into an order that makes more sense for your operation. Shorter cycle times could open up opportunities for additional improvements that weren’t possible when you were running everything down to the wire. You could take on extra orders, charge extra to expedite certain orders, or shorten your lead time now that you can meet a quicker delivery promise. 3. Reduce cycle time Getting cycle times down is the first active step toward improving your on-time delivery rate and delighting the customer with better service levels. Before getting into how to reduce your cycle times, it’s critical that you understand what you aim to accomplish. The first thing you need to do is establish a goal for your cycle times. To do this, you should research to find what a competitive lead time looks like. Then, you should aim to have your cycle time be a fraction of that lead time. For now, you should aim for around one third to one half of lead times for your cycle time. This will give you flexibility and give you a good picture of what improvements are possible in your operation. Over time, you can optimize the ratio between your cycle time and lead time based ","627 on your business goals. You need to understand the volumes and the cycle reduction goals you are targeting, because this will determine when, where, and how you need to tackle this problem. Now that you have a goal in mind for what your volumes and cycle time should look like, how do you actually get cycle times down? ● Monitor and manage bottlenecks The tricky thing about bottlenecks is that they are constantly changing. You need to understand where they are and how bad they are to quickly address them before they start pushing out your completion dates. Enterprise resource planning systems and other tools can help identify those bottlenecks to make them more visible and allow you to break them. ● Eliminate activities that don’t add value By eliminating the wasteful activities that do not add value, you increase the speed of your business processes. This is a core concept in the Lean methodology, and commonly practiced by leading manufacturing companies. In Lean methodology, there are eight distinct wastes: defects, overproduction, waiting, neglect of human talent/intellect, transportation, inventory, motion, and overprocessing. Reducing these wastes is your top priority if you want to create more value for the customer with what you have. ● Reduce setup activities While setup activities differ for each business, they can be defined as any activity surrounding the actual value-add actions. This can include getting materials, changing tools or equipment, setting fixtures, inspection activities, loading parts, or unloading parts. You should decide if any of these responsibilities could be handled externally or handed off to support roles. Either of these options can increase the productivity and throughput of your operations. ","628 ● Fund improvements in value-add activities No one knows your company’s processes better than the experts who live and breathe them every day. Those are the specific people you want to use to make improvements to your processes. Bringing in someone to temporarily take over their production responsibilities can free up those experts to fix and improve the value-add processes in your operation. This investment quickly pays for itself in productivity improvements and cycle time reduction. ● Add shifts or workers to increase capacity This is the quickest and easiest way to speed up operations. Adding incremental shifts (on second, third, or weekend shifts) will allow you to produce more in the same number of calendar days. This is a great option for recovery efforts, breaking bottlenecks, or handling incremental growth. When adding extra shifts, you will likely encounter problems with a fixed supply of labor. Individual workers can only do so much before productivity suffers, or they burnout and go somewhere else. For this reason, you should look at ways to find additional workers to accomplish your extra work, whether that’s temp staffing or a solution tailored to the needs of manufacturing and logistics operations, like on-demand labor. 4. Optimize the order of your processes With a reduced cycle time, you have the flexibility you need to carry out processes in whatever order makes the most sense for your business. For example, if you were using the same machine for multiple different product lines before, and you had to switch which product you were putting through the machine constantly, now you might be able to eliminate the constant swapping and save setup time. Now that you don’t have to rush multiple orders through production at once, you can just finish one product line before moving to the next. This becomes a virtuous cycle of improvements, as your cycle times decrease due to process improvements, again giving you more time to find opportunities to improve ","629 processes. 5. Leverage your scheduling flexibility for profit When you reduce your cycle times drastically enough, you free up extra time before your customer expects the order. If the cycle time reduction leads to a reduction of your lead times, that allows you to take on more orders in the same amount of time. This unlocks additional opportunities for revenue by making you faster within your four walls. There are many ways you could use this extra time to your benefit: reducing lead times to be more competitive, taking on more orders in the same amount of time, or offering the option for customers to pay more for expedited orders. We’ll dive into each of those options next. Option 1: Reduce lead times Now that you know you can deliver faster because you aren’t waiting as long for your production to finish, you could offer the customer a shorter lead time. This makes you more competitive in the market if delivery speed is a factor. It would also allow you to take on more orders throughout the year because you can keep products moving quickly through your facility. Option 2: Take on more orders at once If you prefer to have more flexibility, you could take on more orders at once and promise the same lead time as you did before the cycle time improvements. By not shortening the lead times you promise to the customer, this leaves you room to accept additional orders if you want to take them, or stop taking orders if you encounter any hiccups and need the time to sort them out. Option 3: Offer options for expedited orders One way to make additional revenue from your newfound extra time is to offer your customers the option to expedite orders for a fee. If you do not shorten the lead time you promise the customer, you can take on additional orders you normally wouldn’t have before the cycle time improvements. To gain additional revenue from these new orders, you could charge a percentage fee to have their order expedited and prioritized over other orders you are ","630 processing at the same time, without sacrificing lead times to any of your customers. 6. Continue to improve cycle time and lead time The process of improving cycle times and leveraging the extra time by reducing lead times or taking on extra orders can be repeated. Along the way, you will see “cost out” improvements due to increased efficiency in your processes and a lower cost per unit as you spread your overhead costs across more output. Finding workers to increase capacity As mentioned above, additional workers can remove constraints and help you reduce cycle times tremendously. The question is: would you rather go hunt for employees that you’d keep even after the work is gone, or would you rather have the extra workers only when you need them for growth initiatives like cycle time reduction? ","631 Theory of Constraints: Break Your Bottlenecks our organization likely shares a common thread with most others – the goal of making a profit. This may be your goal for its own sake, or your organization may need to generate profits to enable its pursuit of other goals. You’ve probably got things that are holding you back from this, but sometimes it’s hard to know what these constraints are and how to eliminate them. What is the Theory of Constraints? The core idea of TOC is that all organizations are a series of linked processes in which we perform value added activities to convert sales to profit. In any series, one of these processes is the weakest link in the chain and thereby the limiting factor. Improving the weakest link will increase the throughput of that process and therefore the throughput of the entire system. This is not a new idea, but one that’s been vetted by industry leaders for years. In my early days at GE, I was required to read a book called “The Goal” by Eliyahu Goldratt, which introduces the Theory of Constraints. The book was impactful then, and even today it’s reported that Jeff Bezos has all his executives read it. That’s because when applied to your operation, TOC is a powerful way of thinking which you can use to eliminate your bottlenecks. Before you dive into the process of applying TOC, there are two underlying concepts we need to lay out. You need to first understand what your constraint is and then how you can measure your progress toward removing that constraint. What is a constraint? Constraints (or “bottlenecks” as typically referred to in manufacturing) are anything that keep your organization from reaching its goal. It’s easy to jump to the tangible roadblocks within your four walls, but there are many different types of constraints that might not be as obvious. I’ve categorized and briefly outlined these in the table ","632 below: Type Constraint (Bottleneck) Description Internal Physical Tangible and can be a piece of equipment, workstation, amount of space, inspection, material shortage, etc. People Can be a lack of quantity, skill, flexibility, cross training, etc. Policy / Paradigm Mandated or recommended ways of working and the beliefs of the company. SOPs, regulations, contracts, OT policies, screenings, \"this is how we do things here.\" External Market If all internal constraints are continually broken, supply exceeds demand and the constraint becomes the market. As you solve issues and mature in your use of TOC, you will encounter the need to question and address the self-imposed ideological constraints of your operation. There are some limitations that can be removed if you just know how to get rid of them. To remove your bottlenecks, you need to understand what to change, why to change it, what it should look like after, and how to make the changes. Of course, you’ll need a way of measuring your progress along the way as well. We’ll cover that in the next section. How do you measure progress? One of the key premises of the Theory of Constraints is to improve profits by optimizing in the three key areas outlined below: ","633 Measurement Description Throughput The rate at which the system generates money from sales. Inventory All of the money that has been invested in physical things: inventory, machinery, real estate. Operational expense All of the money spent to create throughput: payroll, taxes, training, etc. You will improve profit if you increase throughput and reduce investment and operating expenses. Throughput accounting, a method proposed by Goldratt as an alternative to cost accounting, is preferred for evaluating the effectiveness of targeted TOC efforts. Because throughput accounting focuses more on throughput, you would know your efforts are successful if you see improvements in investment turns, return on investment, productivity, and net profit. Five focusing steps for applying the Theory of Constraints The Theory of Constraints uses a five-step process to eliminate constraints. This section will outline and explain what the five steps are in this continuous process for eliminating constraints. 1. Identify the Constraint: Walk around your facility looking for some of these common indicators and understand the entire process. One indicator is work in process, which usually builds up before the constraint. Other indicators could be those processes or equipment with the longest cycle times, those areas that constantly need expediting, or steps preceding areas that run out of material often. It will help if you capture all the potential constraints and leverage available data to slim down the list. 2. Exploit the Constraint: The idea of exploiting the constraint is to attack the low hanging fruit and get the most throughput improvement out of the bottleneck with your current available resources. Keep this asset operating ","634 24/7, offload volume to other equipment if you can. Focus should be taken to ensure maintenance is performed to drive uptime and that only quality parts are being processed so as not to waste that time. 3. Subordinate and Synchronize to the Constraint: All other non-constraint processes are less important, and because they are not the limiting factor, they therefore have excess capacity. Build processes around inventory in front of and immediately after the constraint to make sure that it is not starved or blocked. There are a variety of techniques that can be used to protect the constraint while minimizing the cost of incremental inventory. 4. Elevate Performance of the Constraint: In this step you go deeper to look at ways to improve the throughput of the machine. At this stage, you might need better overall Equipment Effectiveness, setup or cycle time improvements, externalizing in cycle work content, or additional capital. Since you could invest significant time and money here, you need to evaluate those decisions based on their impact on Investment Turns, Return on Investment, Productivity, and Net Profit. 5. Repeat the Process: The goal of these steps is to break the constraint, meaning that after some of these improvement actions are taken, the targeted process is no longer the limiting factor and the constraint moves somewhere else. As soon as that happens, stop where you are and begin back at step one on the new constraint. Each plant, product, process, supply chain, system, method is unique. In using TOC methodology your team will undoubtedly encounter every type of constraint and will need to work through creative solutions that can quickly impact your immediate and long-term initiatives. Applying the Theory of Constraints using on-demand labor One of the four types of constraints we listed above is people. Often, not having enough labor is a big bottleneck that businesses just accept. Maybe you’ve been in their shoes, so rather than hire more full-time workers you’ll have to fire later, you just hold your headcount at a constant level the best you can and plan around this bottleneck. ","635 This is like getting stuck at step three of the five steps above. You’ve identified labor as the constraint and worked around it. However, to proceed, you will need to elevate the performance of this constraint. In this case, that means adding workers to take on additional work or to increase the throughput of your system as a whole. To support your efforts in breaking bottlenecks related to people constraints, as well as the other types of constraints, we have outlined in the table below where and how an on-demand labor platform can be most effective. Using on-demand labor to address different types of constraints Constraint Impact of On-Demand Labor Application Physical constraints Low The main application for on-demand labor here would be to bring in support to help with projects to increase throughput by letting your full-time employees focus on the constraint. Examples: moving or expanding areas, converting buffer sizes, layout changes. People constraints High Tapping into a variety of skill sets and scaling your workforce up and down as needed can be the single easiest way to increase ","636 throughput while decreasing operational expense and cost of inventory. Policy / Paradigm constraints Medium Changing the culture, habits, and ways of thinking in a company is never easy. Using an on- demand labor platform is an easy way to introduce a new concept and gain early success to build momentum. Market constraints High Constraints will always be internal until you reach the demand of the market. If market volume drops, your business will have excess operational expenses in labor costs that eat into profits. Having an on- demand labor pool would allow you to instantly stop your usage of the flexible workforce in real time, so that you can insulate yourself from layoffs and protect the profit gains you have made. Using on-demand labor for the five focusing steps In the below table, we summarize the impact of on-demand labor in each of the five ","637 focusing steps of implementing TOC on any one constraint: Focus Impact of On- Demand Labor Application Identify the Constraint Low No one understands your operation better than your employees. The main application here would be to bring in support so that your key employees can support the effort in finding the constraint without impact to your current production efforts. Exploit the Constraint High The easiest way to expand throughput is to scale second, third, and weekend shifts around those bottlenecks. Use an on-demand labor platform to cover that bottleneck or to backfill other areas when you move your platform to cover that bottleneck or to backfill other areas when you move your employees there for 24/7 coverage. Since constraints move, that help may only be needed temporarily. Leveraging on-demand operators is quicker than traditional staffing methods. Subordinat e the Constraint Medium This step involves a lot of testing, planning, and shifting plans and people around. Trying, learning, and refining are invaluable steps for your full-time employees to become part of the solution. On- demand labor can help by doing some of the lower skilled, repetitive work so that your full-time employees can engage in cross-training and upskilling. ","638 Elevate the Constraint High Your employees that perform the work daily are the experts you need to leverage to uncover the detailed opportunity that exists in your operation. Bring in on- demand labor to support production needs and free them up for kaizen events, detailed time studies, programming changes, setup improvements, etc. You can also explore using piecework pay to incentivize the discovery of new productivity ideas from fresh observers. Repeat High As bottlenecks change, having a labor pool of skilled and reliable workers available to work on demand is a powerful asset. Key takeaways for manufacturing and logistics The Theory of Constraints has been a popular continuous improvement strategy for nearly 40 years, and it has many similarities to Lean concepts and tools. You can apply TOC successfully in distribution/logistics or manufacturing operations to bring you fast improvements, reduced lead times, reduced inventory, improved capacity, and increased profits. Although not easy to attain, these results can turn your business around or make your business more competitive in the market.

Continuous Flow What is FLOW? Flow is about how the Material or the Information we are processing moves from start point to the end point. So it is about what happens to them while it's in process and how the process overall compares to what could be seen as a perfect process. The best way to run a process is to use minimum resources and minimum elapsed time during the process. The entire focus should be to make the processes Lean. As we all know there is always room for improvement and we can never get a perfect process. There are organizations who are improving continuously and on a daily basis and there are organizations which are far from perfecting. The reason behind this is not because perfection is impossible, but because they have never attempted to reach or even define perfection and see where they are standing currently. Therefore organizations focus should be upon improving the flow (Material & Information), thereby steadily eliminating mura (unevenness/variation) through the system and not upon waste reduction. Techniques to improve flow include production leveling, “pull” production and the Heijunka box. The implementation of smooth flow exposes quality problems that already exist and thus waste reduction naturally happens as a consequence. The “flow” (or smoothness) based approach aims to achieve JIT, by removing the variation caused by work scheduling and thereby provide a driver, rationale or target and priorities for implementation, using a variety of techniques. The effort to achieve JIT exposes many quality problems that are hidden by buffer stocks; by forcing smooth flow of only value-adding steps, these problems become visible and must be dealt with explicitly. ","640 How to create continuous flow?

E.g. shorten the travel distance & time of machine moving parts. ● Split apart some of the bottleneck tasks Machine performs & use more than one machine to perform them. ● Install two Machines of the same type at the bottleneck point in the Cell. ● Create two Cells instead of one. ● Remove the bottleneck Machine from Cell & operate it separately by Supermarket Pull system. Guidelines for material management in Cellular Layout ● Keep parts as close as possible to the ‘Point of use’. ● Keep parts so the operator can use both hands simultaneously. ● Try to keep at parts variation at operators fingertips. ● Use fail safe storage Mechanisms to prevent mixing of parts. ● Do not have operators to restock their own stock. ● Keep no more than 2 hrs. material at ‘Point of use’. ● Do not store additional parts near the process. ● Utilize KANBAN to regulate material replenishment ● Design part container convenient for operators not for material handlers. In multiple finished goods pack out quantity. ● Do not interrupt the operator's cycle to replenish parts. Guidelines for determining number of operators ● < 0.3 Operators : Do not add extra Operators. Further reduce waste or incidental work. ● 0.3 – 0.5 Operator: Do not add extra Operator yet. After two weeks of Cell Operation & Kaizen, carefully evaluate if enough waste & incidental work have ","642 been taken out. ● > 0.5 Operator: Add extra Operator if necessary. Continue reducing waste & incidental work to eventually eliminate the need of that Operator. Methods of work distribution among operators ● Split the Work: Try to allot equal work for equal time for each Operator. ● The Circuit: One Operator performs one Takt time work element completely & second Operator follows a few steps behind. ● Reverse Flow: Operators move in the opposite direction of the material flow. ● A Combination: Combination of Split , Circuit & Reverse flow as per Gemba requirement. ● One Operator per Station: Used where manual work is much more than automated equipment. ● The Ratchet: Possible where work elements are the same. Stages of implementing FLOW Stage 1: Initial Process Design Cell Designing team should be small & work on Shop floor only. Stage 2: Mock-up Use Standard Work Chart only. Stage 3: Debugging Making improvements in a Cell after it runs for a period. Stage 4: Sustaining the Flow By rapid response to problems, frequent Audits, Improvements. Points to be kept in mind Debugging is categorizing work motions into Wasteful, Incidental & Value adding. ","643 Eliminating Wasteful & trying to minimize Incidental Work motions. ● Keep elapsed time between communicating new Process & actually starting it up as short as possible. ● The Engineers & Maintenance staff need to work until the new process functions as designed. ● We should plan ahead & build up stock to meet customer demand during transition. ● Do not change Takt time during the debugging period. ● Achieving 60% of Target production on the first day is Good. 80% in a week time & 90% in two weeks time. ● The Cell’s success is everyone’s responsibility. ● Implement improvement ideas quickly. Overnight if possible. ● The ‘Operator Balance Chart’ & ‘Standard Work Chart’ must be kept updated. ● Continuous Flow has no option. ● Work elements must be relisted & retimed carefully. ● Make milestones that prove you are making progress. SMED (SINGLE-MINUTE EXCHANGE OF DIE)- QUICK CHANGEOVER METHOD Changeover times can be dramatically reduced – in many cases to less than 10 minutes. Each element of the changeover is analyzed to see if it can be eliminated, moved, simplified, or streamlined. What is SMED? SMED (Single-Minute Exchange of Die) is a system for dramatically reducing the time it takes to complete equipment changeovers. The essence of the SMED system is to convert as many changeover steps as possible to “external” (performed while the equipment is running), and to simplify and streamline the remaining steps. The name Single-Minute Exchange of Die comes from the goal of reducing changeover times to the “single” digits (i.e., less than 10 minutes). ","644 SMED Benefits A successful SMED program will have the following benefits: ● Lower Manufacturing Cost: faster changeovers mean less equipment downtime ● Smaller Lot Sizes: faster changeovers enable more frequent product changes ● Improved Responsiveness to Customer Demand: smaller lot sizes enable more flexible scheduling ● Lower Inventory Levels: smaller lot sizes result in lower inventory levels ● Smoother Startups: standardized changeover processes improve consistency and quality Basics of SMED SMED was developed by Shigeo Shingo, a Japanese industrial engineer who was extraordinarily successful in helping companies dramatically reduce their changeover times. His pioneering work led to documented reductions in changeover times averaging 94% (e.g., from 90 minutes to less than 5 minutes) across a wide range of companies. Changeover times that improve by a factor of 20 may be hard to imagine, but consider the simple example of changing a tire: ● For many people, changing a single tire can easily take 15 minutes. ● For a NASCAR pit crew, changing four tires takes less than 15 seconds. Many techniques used by NASCAR pit crews (performing as many steps as possible before the pit stop begins; using a coordinated team to perform multiple steps in parallel; creating a standardized and highly optimized process) are also used in SMED. In fact, the journey from a 15-minute tire changeover to a 15-second tire changeover can be considered a SMED journey. In SMED, changeovers are made up of steps that are termed “elements”. There are two types of elements: ● Internal Elements: elements that must be completed while the equipment is ","645 stopped ● External Elements: elements that can be completed while the equipment is running The SMED process focuses on making as many elements as possible external and simplifying and streamlining all elements. SMED EXAMPLE An excellent way to learn more about SMED is to walk through an implementation example. This section provides a step-by-step roadmap for a simple and practical SMED implementation. Before Starting Virtually every manufacturing company that performs changeovers can benefit from SMED. That does not mean, however, that SMED should be the first priority. In the real world, companies have finite resources, and those resources should be directed to where they will generate the best return. So what should be the first priority? For most companies, the first priority should be ensuring that there is a clear understanding of where productive time is being lost and that decisions on improvement initiatives are made based on hard data. That means putting a system in place to collect and analyze manufacturing performance data. The de facto “gold” standard for manufacturing performance data is measuring OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) with an additional breakdown of OEE loss categories into the Six Big Losses and a detailed breakdown of OEE Availability losses into Downtime Reason Codes (including codes for tracking changeover time). Once a system for measuring manufacturing performance is in place collect data for at least two weeks to gain a clear picture of where productive time is being lost. ","646 Item Description SMED If changeovers represent a significant percentage of lost productive time (e.g., at least 20%) consider proceeding with a SMED program. TPM Otherwise, consider first focusing on a TPM (Total Productive Maintenance) program. Step One – Identify Pilot Area In this step, the target area for the pilot SMED program is selected. The ideal equipment will have the following characteristics: ITEM DESCRIPTION Duration The changeover is long enough to have significant room for improvement, but not too long as to be overwhelming in scope (e.g., a one hour changeover presents a good balance). Variation There is large variation in changeover times (e.g., changeover times range from one to three hours). Opportunitie s There are multiple opportunities to perform the changeover each week (so proposed improvements can be quickly tested). Familiarity Employees familiar with the equipment (operators, maintenance personnel, quality assurance, and supervisors) are engaged and motivated. ","647 Constraint The equipment is a constraint/bottleneck – thus improvements will bring immediate benefits. If constraint equipment is selected, minimize the potential risk by building temporary stock and otherwise ensuring that unanticipated downtime can be tolerated. In order to create a wide base of support for the SMED project, include the full spectrum of associated employees in the selection process, and work hard to create a consensus within the team as to the target equipment choice. Once the target equipment has been selected, record a baseline time for the changeover. Changeover time should be measured as the time between production of the last good part (at full speed) and production of the first good part (at full speed). Be cognizant of the “Hawthorne Effect”; changeover times may temporarily improve as a simple result of observing the process. When possible, use prior data to baseline the changeover time. Step Two – Identify Elements In this step, the team works together to identify all of the elements of the changeover. The most effective way of doing this is to videotape the entire changeover and then work from the videotape to create an ordered list of elements, each of which includes: ● Description: what work is performed ● Cost in Time: how long the element takes to complete Some useful tips for this step: ITEM DESCRIPTION Elements A typical changeover will result in 30 to 50 elements being documented. ","648 Sticky Notes A fast method of capturing elements is to create a series of post-it notes that are stuck to a wall in the order in which they are performed during the changeover. Man and Machine Be sure to capture both “human” elements (elements where the operator is doing something) and “equipment” elements (elements where the equipment is doing something). As discussed later, the human elements are usually easiest to optimize. Other Notes While videotaping the changeover have several observers taking notes. Sometimes the observers will notice things that are missed on the videotape. Observe Only observe – let the changeover take its normal course. The deliverable from this step should be a complete list of changeover elements, each with a description and time “cost”. Step Three – Separate External Elements In this step, elements of the changeover process that can be performed with little or no change while the equipment is running are identified and moved “external” to the changeover (i.e., performed before or after the changeover). It is not unusual for changeover times to be cut nearly in half with this step alone. For each element the team should ask the following question: Can this element, as currently performed or with minimal change, be completed while the equipment is running? If the answer is yes, categorize the element as external and move it before or after the changeover, as appropriate. Examples of candidate elements for such treatment include: ","649 ITEM DESCRIPTION Retrieval Retrieval of parts, tools, materials, and/or instructions. Inspection Inspection of parts, tools, and/or materials. Cleaning Cleaning tasks that can be performed while the process is running. Quality Quality checks for the last production run. The deliverable from this step should be an updated list of changeover elements, split into three parts: External Elements (Before Changeover), Internal Elements (During Changeover), and External Elements (After Changeover). Step Four – Convert Internal Elements to External In this step, the current changeover process is carefully examined, with the goal of converting as many internal elements to external as possible. For each internal element, the team should ask the following questions: If there was a way to make this element external, what would it be? How could we do it? This will result in a list of elements that are candidates for further action. This list should be prioritized so the most promising candidates are acted on first. Fundamentally, this comes down to performing a cost/benefit analysis for each candidate element: ● Cost as measured by the materials and labor needed to make the necessary changes. ● Benefit as measured by the time that will be eliminated from the changeover. Once the list has been prioritized work can begin on making the necessary changes. Examples of techniques that can be used to convert internal elements to external are: ","650 ITEM DESCRIPTION Advance Preparation Prepare parts in advance (e.g., preheat dies in advance of the changeover) Jigs Use duplicate jigs (e.g., perform alignment and other adjustments in advance of the changeover) Modularize Modularize equipment (e.g., replace a printer instead of adjusting the print head so the printer can be configured for a new part number in advance of the changeover) Modify Modify equipment (e.g., add guarding to enable safe cleaning while the process is running) The deliverable from this step should be an updated list of changeover elements, with fewer internal elements, and additional external elements (performed before or after the changeover). Step Five – Streamline Remaining Elements In this step, the remaining elements are reviewed with an eye towards streamlining and simplifying so they can be completed in less time. First priority should be given to internal elements to support the primary goal of shortening the changeover time. For each element, the team should ask the following questions: How can this element be completed in less time? How can we simplify this element? As in the previous step a simple cost/benefit analysis should be used to prioritize action on elements. ","651 Examples of techniques that can be used to streamline elements are: ITEM DESCRIPTION Release Eliminate bolts (e.g., use quick release mechanisms or other types of functional clamps) Adjustment Eliminate adjustments (e.g., use standardized numerical settings; convert adjustments to multiple fixed settings; use visible centerlines; use shims to standardize die size) Motion Eliminate motion (e.g., reorganize the work space) Waiting Eliminate waiting (e.g., make first article inspection a high priority for QA) Standardizing Standardize hardware (e.g., so fewer tools are needed) Operations Create parallel operations (e.g., note that with multiple operators working on the same equipment close attention must be paid to potential safety issues) Mechanize Mechanize (normally this is considered a last resort) The deliverable from this step should be a set of updated work instructions for the changeover (i.e., creating Standardized Work) and a significantly faster changeover time! ACCELERATE PROGRESS When implementing SMED, it is helpful to recognize that there are two broad categories of improvement: ● Human: achieved through preparation and organization ● Technical: achieved through engineering ","652 Experience has taught that the human elements are typically much faster and less expensive to improve then the technical elements. In other words, the quick wins are usually with the human elements. Avoid the temptation, especially with technically proficient teams, to over-focus on technical elements. Instead, focus first on the human elements. The following chart illustrates this principle, showing example areas of opportunity for SMED projects. HEIJUNKA (平準化, へいじゅんか): THE ART OF LEVELING PRODUCTION Heijunka (pronounced hi-JUNE-kuh) is a Japanese word that means “leveling.” When implemented correctly, heijunka elegantly – and without haste – helps organizations meet demand while reducing wastes in production and interpersonal processes. According to many Lean experts, heijunka is better achieved as a later-stage implementation in a Lean organization, long after value streams have been identified and solidified and refined, when Lean philosophy and legacy are already deeply embedded into process and materials cycles. ","653 What Is Heijunka? Here is how Lean Lexicon, 4th Edition defines heijunka: “Leveling the type and quantity of production over a fixed period of time. This enables production to efficiently meet customer demands while avoiding batching and results in minimum inventories, capital costs, manpower, and production lead time through the whole value stream.” Figure 1: Relationship Among Predictability, Flexibility and Stability Is Heijunka – When implemented correctly, heijunka provides predictability by leveling demand, flexibility by decreasing changeover time and stability by averaging production volume and type over the long term. Batching is what mass producers do. For example, Ford Motor Company when it first started was a mass producer. Company founder Henry Ford was fond of saying that customers could have any color Model A they wanted, as long as it was black. Daniel T. Jones, founder and chairman of the Lean Enterprise Academy, writes: “Years ago, Toyota reached the counter-intuitive conclusion that this [batching] is a bad idea. Its reasoning was that no production system can be continuously responsive to gyrating orders without suffering from mura (unevenness in productivity and quality), and muri (overburden of machines, managers, and production associates). And mura and muri together create muda (waste).” ","654 Leveling by Volume or Type Let’s look at leveling volume. Say a hat producer receives orders for 500 of the same hat per week: 200 orders on Monday, 100 on Tuesday, 50 on Wednesday, 100 on Thursday, and 50 on Friday. Instead of trying to meet demand in sequence of the orders, the hat producer would use heijunka to level demand by producing an inventory of 100 hats near shipping to fulfill Monday’s orders. Every Monday, 100 hats will be in inventory. The rest of the week, production will make 100 hats per day – a level amount. The inventory might look a little suspicious to Lean purists, but it has its fans – it is the method the Toyota Production System uses today. What if the situation involves multiple types of hats? Consider that orders are being placed for hat models A, B, C and D. A mass producer will want to minimize waste around equipment changeovers. Its production schedule will look something like this: AAAAABBBCCDD. But what if a buyer decides at the last minute that orders of A need to be B instead? What if order volumes for A suddenly drop off the map and orders for C begin to increase? A mass producer might be desperate to find capacity to make more C while its A capacity sits. To avoid such waste, a heijunka production schedule might look like AABCDAABCDAB, with emphasis placed on efficient changeover times and buffer inventories that meet demand for more popular items. In 2004, reporter Jonathan Fahey wrote in Forbes about Toyotas USA’s efforts to allow dealers to change product attributes, such as color, from sales floor computers by looking at what was queued up in factory – crushing production-related lead times because they had achieved highly efficient changeover times through heijunka. ","655 Production Meets Demand with Heijunka Before talking about putting heijunka in place, let’s consider how Lean expert Michael Ballé describes the importance of heijunka to Lean organizations: By producing every product during every relevant timeframe, lead time is reduced and the business is closer to meeting “real” demand. That is the essence of heijunka: pulling production tight and cozy with demand. If all product types are created (and stored as necessary) throughout a year, flexibility is increased, the hats should all sell (perhaps not immediately, but eventually) and production will be able to meet peak demand periods. What’s the catch? Changeover time. Heijunka depends significantly upon putting a percentage of capacity (Ballé recommends 10 percent) into changeover flexibility. “If you want to make every product every day, which is kind of the Lean first goal, you need to reduce changeover time accordingly,” Ballé writes. Demand forecasts are often not quite right, and sometimes completely wrong. Increasing changeover flexibility and efficiency protects a production line from demand ambushes set up by the forecasts themselves. The frame of any heijunka implementation should begin with takt time and end with a heijunka box. Takt time is the time it takes to complete a product in order to meet customer ","656 demand. It represents the rate at which customers buy a company’s product and at the end of a day or a week, it will show how much of product A, B, C or D needs to be shipped (or finished – as heijunka is not just for manufacturing; it can be used in front and back office settings – in any setting that has a discernible supply and demand). Figure 2: Example of Heijunka Box – The heijunka box helps visualize the optimized production schedule. Each square on the board represents a kanban to signal production of a single product. The “pigeon holes” are implied – the kanbans fit in them. Each square on a given day represents one product to be made. In this example, for the timeframe Monday through Friday, two of the pink products are made each day, represented by two squares (kanbans). Heijunka boxes are literal boxes on the production floor that signal workers to know what to make next during the day. Core Concepts to Guide Heijunka Implementation Keeping in mind the core concepts about heijunka will help keep a company heading in the right direction. Takt time: The time it takes to finish a product in order to meet customer demand; can be thought of as the customer buying rate. It is the guidance for the entire heijunka implementation. Volume leveling: Manufacture at levels of long-term average demand and keep a buffer inventory proportional to variability in demand, stability of production process and shipping speed. Type leveling: Essentially, make every product every day and reserve capacity for changeover flexibility; use a heijunka box to visualize the production flow and schedule. ","657 Heijunka box: A working diagram of type leveling and production schedule. Work slowly and consistently: Taiichi Ohno, founder of the Toyota Production System, says it best: “The slower but consistent tortoise causes less waste and is much more desirable than the speedy hare that races ahead and then stops occasionally to doze. The Toyota Production System can be realized only when all the workers become tortoises.” Changeover time: Efficiency of changeover is the fulcrum of heijunka; narrowing changeover times helps tighten the value stream between supply and demand. Buffer inventory: Having some product ready to ship at the beginning of each production cycle is essential to smoothing production and leveling demand at consistent rates and quality so that resource waste is minimized on the line. Type standardization: By manufacturing one of each product or service a day, knowledge can be more readily shared across types to benefit every process. ","658 Kaizen (改善, かいぜん)/ Continuous Improvement Kaizen (改善, かいぜん), the Japanese word for \"improvement\", is a concept referring to business activities that continuously improve all functions and involve all employees from the CEO to the assembly line workers. Kaizen also applies to processes, such as purchasing and logistics, that cross organizational boundaries into the supply chain. It has been applied in healthcare, psychotherapy, life coaching, government, and banking. By improving standardized programs and processes, kaizen aims to eliminate waste and redundancies (lean manufacturing). Kaizen was first practiced in Japanese businesses after World War II, influenced in part by American business and quality- management teachers, and most notably as part of The Toyota Way. It has since spread throughout the world and has been applied to environments outside business and productivity. History of Kaizen The small-step work improvement approach was developed in the USA under the Training Within Industry program (TWI Job Methods). Instead of encouraging large, radical changes to achieve desired goals, these methods recommended that organizations introduce small improvements, preferably ones that could be implemented on the same day. The major reason was that during WWII there was neither time nor resources for large and innovative changes in the production of war equipment.The essence of the approach came down to improving the use of the existing workforce and technologies. ","659 As part of the Marshall Plan after World War II, American occupation forces brought in experts to help with the rebuilding of Japanese industry while the Civil Communications Section (CCS) developed a management training program that taught statistical control methods as part of the overall material. Homer Sarasohn and Charles Protzman developed and taught this course in 1949–1950. Sarasohn recommended W. Edwards Deming for further training in statistical methods. The Economic and Scientific Section (ESS) group was also tasked with improving Japanese management skills and Edgar McVoy was instrumental in bringing Lowell Mellen to Japan to properly install the Training Within Industry (TWI) programs in 1951. The ESS group had a training film to introduce TWI's three \"J\" programs: Job Instruction, Job Methods and Job Relations. Titled \"Improvement in Four Steps\" (Kaizen eno Yon Dankai) it thus introduced kaizen to Japan. For the pioneering, introduction, and implementation of kaizen in Japan, the Emperor of Japan awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure to Dr. Deming in 1960. Subsequently, the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) instituted the annual Deming Prizes for achievement in quality and dependability of products. On October 18, 1989, JUSE awarded the Deming Prize to Florida Power & Light Co. (FPL), based in the US, for its exceptional accomplishments in process and quality-control management, making it the first company outside Japan to win the Deming Prize. Kaoru Ishikawa took up this concept to define how continuous improvement or kaizen can be applied to processes, as long as all the variables of the process are known. Overview of Kaizen The Japanese word kaizen means \"change for better\", an inherent meaning of either \"continuous\" or \"philosophy\" in Japanese dictionaries and in everyday use. The word refers to any improvement, one-time or continuous, large or small, in the same sense as the English word \"improvement\". However, given the common practice in Japan of labeling industrial or business improvement techniques with the word \"kaizen\", particularly the practices spearheaded by Toyota, the word \"kaizen\" in English is typically applied to measures for implementing continuous improvement, especially those with a \"Japanese ","660 philosophy\". The discussion below focuses on such interpretations of the word, as frequently used in the context of modern management discussions. Two kaizen approaches have been distinguished: ● Point Kaizen Point Kaizen is one of the most commonly implemented types of kaizen.It happens very quickly and usually without much planning. As soon as something is found broken or incorrect, quick and immediate measures are taken to correct the issues. These measures are generally small, isolated and easy to implement.; however, they can have a huge impact. In some cases, it is also possible that the positive effects of point kaizen in one area can reduce or eliminate benefits of point kaizen in some other areas. Examples of point kaizen include a shop inspection by a supervisor who finds broken materials or other small issues, and then asks the owner of the shop to perform a quick kaizen (5S) to rectify those issues. Or a line worker notices a potential improvement in efficiency by placing the materials needed in another order or closer to the production line in order to minimize downtime. ● System Kaizen System kaizen is accomplished in an organized manner and is devised to address system-level problems in an organization. It is an upper-level strategic planning method for a short period of time. ● Line Kaizen ","661 ➢ Plane Kaizen This is the next upper level of line kaizen, in that several lines are connected together. In modern terminologies, this can also be described as a value stream, where instead of traditional departments, the organization is structured into product lines or families and value streams. It can be visualized as changes or improvements made to one line being implemented to multiple other lines or processes. ➢ Cube Kaizen Cube kaizen describes the situation where all the points of the planes are connected to each other and no point is disjointed from any other. This would resemble a situation where Lean has spread across the entire organization. Improvements are made up and down through the plane, or upstream or downstream, including the complete organization, suppliers and customers. This might require some changes in the standard business processes as well. Kaizen is a daily process, the purpose of which goes beyond simple productivity improvement. It is also a process that, when done correctly, humanizes the workplace, eliminates overly hard work (muri), and teaches people how to perform experiments on their work using the scientific method and how to learn to spot and eliminate waste in business processes. In all, the process suggests a humanized ","662 approach to workers and to increasing productivity: \"The idea is to nurture the company's people as much as it is to praise and encourage participation in kaizen activities.\" Successful implementation requires \"the participation of workers in the improvement.\" People at all levels of an organization participate in kaizen, from the CEO down to janitorial staff, as well as external stakeholders when applicable. Kaizen is most commonly associated with manufacturing operations, as at Toyota, but has also been used in non-manufacturing environments. The format for kaizen can be individual, suggestion system, small group, or large group. At Toyota, it is usually a local improvement within a workstation or local area and involves a small group in improving their own work environment and productivity. This group is often guided through the kaizen process by a line supervisor; sometimes this is the line supervisor's key role. Kaizen on a broad, cross- departmental scale in companies, generates total quality management, and frees human efforts through improving productivity using machines and computing power. While kaizen (at Toyota) usually delivers small improvements, the culture of continual aligned small improvements and standardization yields large results in terms of overall improvement in productivity. This philosophy differs from the \"command and control\" improvement programs (e.g., Business Process Improvement) of the mid-20th century. Kaizen methodology includes making changes and monitoring results, then adjusting. Large-scale pre- planning and extensive project scheduling are replaced by smaller experiments, which can be rapidly adapted as new improvements are suggested.[citation needed] In modern usage, it is designed to address a particular issue over the course of a week and is referred to as a \"kaizen blitz\" or \"kaizen event\". These are limited in scope, and issues that arise from them are typically used in later blitzes.[citation needed] A person who makes a large contribution in the successful implementation of kaizen during kaizen events is awarded the title of \"Zenkai\". In the 21st century, business consultants in various countries have engaged in widespread adoption and sharing of the kaizen framework as a way to help their clients restructure and ","663 refocus their business processes. 10 principles of Kaizen Because executing Kaizen requires enabling the right mindset throughout a company, 10 principles that address the Kaizen mindset are commonly referenced as core to the philosophy. They are: 1. Let go of assumptions. 2. Be proactive about solving problems. 3. Don't accept the status quo. 4. Let go of perfectionism and take an attitude of iterative, adaptive change. 5. Look for solutions as you find mistakes. 6. Create an environment in which everyone feels empowered to contribute. 7. Don't accept the obvious issue; instead, ask \"why\" five times to get to the root cause. 8. Cull information and opinions from multiple people. 9. Use creativity to find low-cost, small improvements. 10. Never stop improving. Kaizen cycle for continuous improvement Kaizen can be implemented in a seven-step cycle to create an environment based on continuous improvement. This systematic method includes the following steps: ● Get employees involved. Seek the involvement of employees, including soliciting their help in identifying issues and problems. Doing so creates buy- in for change. Often, this is organized as specific groups of individuals charged with gathering and relaying information from a wider group of employees. ● Find problems. Using widespread feedback from all employees, gather a list of problems and potential opportunities. Create a list if there are many issues. ● Create a solution. Encourage employees to offer creative solutions, with all manner of ideas encouraged. Pick a winning solution or solutions from the ideas presented. ● Test the solution. Implement the winning solution chosen above, with everyone participating in the rollout. Create pilot programs or take other small steps to test out the solution. ","664 ● Analyze the results. At various intervals, check progress, with specific plans for who will be the point of contact and how best to keep ground-level workers engaged. Determine how successful the change has been. If results are positive, adopt the solution throughout the organization. These seven steps should be repeated on an ongoing basis, with new solutions tested where appropriate or new lists of problems tackled. Types of Kaizen events Although the aim of Kaizen is widespread cultural change, the events to kick-start the efforts involved or focus on a specific set of problems have evolved. In the West, these concentrated efforts to make quick changes to achieve a short- term goal are often the extent of Kaizen efforts. There are numerous names associated with Kaizen events, including Kaizen blitz, Kaizen burst, Kaizen workshop, focused improvement workshop, continuous improvement workshop and rapid process workshop. These events can rely on various tools or focus on specific areas, such as the 5S framework, total productive maintenance and value stream mapping ","665 Kanban(Japanese: カンバン and Chinese: 看板) Kanban is a popular Lean workflow management method for defining, managing, and improving services that deliver knowledge work. It helps you visualize work, maximize efficiency, and improve continuously. Work is represented on Kanban boards, allowing you to optimize work delivery across multiple teams and handle even the most complex projects in a single environment. Originating from manufacturing, it later became a territory claimed by Agile software development teams. Recently, it started getting recognized by business units across various industries. As more and more people hear about Kanban, multiple questions arise: ● What exactly is Kanban? ","666 ● What are the Kanban principles and practices? ● What are the benefits of adopting Kanban? Here are the most important things you need to know about the method and its practical application. Kanban Definition and Brief Introduction Kanban Definition The Japanese word “kanban”, meaning “visual board” or a “sign”, has been used in the sense of a process definition since the 1950s. It was first developed and applied by Toyota as a scheduling system for just-in-time manufacturing. On the other hand, the capitalized term “Kanban” is known and associated with the emergence of the “Kanban Method,” which was first defined in 2007. The Genesis of Kanban Initially, it arose as a scheduling system for lean manufacturing, originating from the Toyota Production System (TPS). In the late 1940s, Toyota introduced “just in time” manufacturing to its production. The approach represents a pull system. This means that production is based on customer demand rather than the standard push practice to produce goods and push them to the market. Their unique production system laid the foundation of Lean manufacturing or simply Lean. Its core purpose is minimizing waste activities without sacrificing productivity. The main goal is to create more value for the customer without generating more costs. The Kanban Method At the beginning of the 21st Century, key players in the software industry quickly realized how Kanban could positively change the way products and services were delivered. With an increased focus on efficiency and by harnessing advances in computing ","667 technology, Kanban left the automotive industry's realm and was successfully applied to other complex commercial sectors such as IT, software development, R&D, and others. Indeed, what we now recognize as the Kanban Method emerged at the beginning of 2007. It is a result of years of testing, experience, and joint efforts of leading figures in the Lean and Agile community such as David Aderson, Dan Vacanti, Darren Davis, Corey Ladas, Dominica DeGrandis, Rick Garber, and others. You can start building your Kanban system by setting up the most straightforward Kanban board with three basic columns – “Requested”, “In Progress” and “Done”. When constructed, managed, and functioning correctly, it serves as a real-time information repository, highlighting bottlenecks within the system and anything else that might interrupt smooth working practices. Kanban Principles Before exploring the Kanban values in more detail, we’d like to establish that the method in the shape and form we embrace and use today emerged due to many people's collaborative efforts. The expanding Kanban community should acknowledge these ideas and contributions as such. ","668 David J. Anderson (a pioneer in the field of Lean/ Kanban for knowledge work and one of the founding fathers of the method) has formulated the Kanban method as an approach to incremental, evolutionary process and systems change for knowledge work organizations. It is focused on getting things done, and its fundamentals can be broken down into two types of principles and six practices. Let's examine what the Kanban principles are. Change Management Principles Service Delivery Principles Start With What You Do Now Focus on Customer’s Needs and Expectations Agree to Pursue Incremental, Evolutionary Change Manage the Work, Not the Workers Encourage Acts of Leadership at All Levels Regularly Review the Network of Services Change Management Principles Blending with the already established processes in a non-disruptive way, pursuing evolutionary changes and continuous improvement. Let’s take a closer look at the Kanban change management principles. Principle 1: Start With What You Do Now Kanban offers the flexibility to use the method on top of existing workflows, systems, and processes without disrupting what is already in place. The method recognizes that existing processes, roles, responsibilities, and titles have value and are, generally, worth preserving. Naturally, it will highlight issues that need to be addressed and help assess and plan changes so their implementation is as non-disruptive as ","669 possible. Principle 2: Agree to Pursue Incremental, Evolutionary Change The Kanban method is designed to meet minimal resistance. It encourages continuous small incremental and evolutionary changes to the current process by implementing collaboration and feedback forms. In general, sweeping changes are discouraged because they usually encounter resistance due to fear or uncertainty. Principle 3: Encourage Acts of Leadership at All Levels Leadership at all levels derives from people's everyday insights and acts to improve their way of working. As insignificant as you may think, each shared observation fosters a continuous improvement mindset (Kaizen) to reach optimal performance on a team/department/company level. This can’t be a management-level activity. Service Delivery Principles Kanban aims at developing a service-oriented approach. It requires that you profoundly understand your customer’s needs, create a network of services where people self-organize around the work, and ensure that your system continuously evolves. Principle 1: Focus on Customer’s Needs and Expectations Delivering value to the customer should be at the center of each organization. Understanding the needs and expectations of your customers brings the attention to the quality of the provided services and the value it creates. Principle 2: Manage the Work Managing the work in your network of services ensures that you empower people’s abilities to self-organize around the work. This enables you to focus on the desired outcomes without the “noise” created by micro-managing the people delivering the services. Principle 3: Regularly Review the Network of Services Once developed, a service-oriented approach requires continuous evaluation to foster a customer service culture. Through the use of regular reviews of the network ","670 of services and assessment of the applied work policies, Kanban encourages the improvement of the delivered results. Kanban Practices When aiming to implement the Kanban method, every organization must be careful with the practical steps. Six core practices need to be present for a successful implementation. While mastering these is vital, it’s an evolving process - close to 40% of all organizations admit that the way they use the Kanban practices still matures. Let’s take a closer look and understand what the six practices of Kanban are. ● Visualize the workflow ● Limit work in progress ● Manage flow ● Make process policies explicit ● Implement feedback loops ● Improve collaboratively 1. Visualize the Workflow To visualize your process with a Kanban system, you will need a board with cards and columns. Each column on the board represents a step in your workflow. Each Kanban card represents a work item. The Kanban board itself represents the actual state of your workflow with all its risks and specifications. The first and most important thing for you is understanding what it takes to get an ","671 item from a request to a deliverable product. Recognizing how work flows through your system will set you on the path to continuous improvement by making well- observed and necessary changes. When you start working on item X, you pull it from the “To Do” column, and when it is completed, you move it to “Done”. This way, you can easily track progress and spot bottlenecks. Naturally, your Kanban board might have a different outlook as it depends on your specific needs and processes. 2. Limit Work in Progress (WIP) One of Kanban's primary functions is to ensure a manageable number of active items are in progress at any one time. If there are no work-in-progress limits, you are not doing Kanban. Switching a team’s focus halfway through will generally harm the process, and multitasking is a sure route to generating waste and inefficiency. Limiting WIP means implementing a pull system on parts or the complete workflow. Setting maximum items per stage ensures that a card is only “pulled” into the next step when there is available capacity. Such constraints will quickly illuminate problem areas in your flow so you can identify and resolve them. 3. Manage Flow Managing the flow is about managing the work but not the people. By flow, we mean the movement of work items through the production process at a predictable and sustainable pace. One of the main goals when implementing a Kanban system is to create a smooth, healthy flow. Instead of micro-managing people and trying to keep them busy all the time, you should focus on managing the work processes and understanding how to get that work faster through the system. This would mean that your Kanban system is creating value more quickly. 4. Make Process Policies Explicit You can’t improve something you don’t understand. This is why your process should be clearly defined, published, and socialized. People would not associate and participate in something they do not believe would be useful. When everyone is familiar with the common goal, they would be able to work and make decisions regarding a positive impact. Sparse, visible, well-defined, and subject ","672 to change (if/when needed), work policies have the power to boost people’s self- organization. 5. Feedback Loops For teams and companies that want to be more agile, implementing feedback loops is a mandatory step. They ensure that organizations are adequately responding to potential changes and enable knowledge transfer between stakeholders. Kanban suggests the use of cadences (feedback loops) at a team level as well as service-oriented cadences. An example of a team-level cadence is the daily Team Kanban Meeting for tracking the status and the flow of work. It helps to identify available capacity and potential for increasing the delivery pace. It takes place in front of the Kanban board, and every member tells the others what they did the previous day and what they will be doing today. Service-oriented cadences in Kanban, such as operations, service delivery, and risk meetings, aim to synchronize and improve your delivery of service. The output of these reviews, such as understanding what is blocking effective service delivery, should serve as a decision-making input for the continuous improvement of your network of services. While focused and regular meetings with fewer attendees have proven to be a good practice, the ideal duration of specific Kanban cadences depends on your context, the team size, and topics. 6. Improve Collaboratively (Using Models & the Scientific Method) The way to achieve continuous improvement and sustainable change within an organization is through collaboratively implementing changes based on scientifically proven methods, feedback, and metrics. Cultivating an organizational culture where every hypothesis is proven to have positive or negative results is crucial for developing a mindset focused on improvement through evolutionary change. ","673 KEY TAKEAWAYS ● The just-in-time (JIT) inventory system is a management strategy that minimizes inventory and increases efficiency. ● Just-in-time manufacturing is also known as the Toyota Production System (TPS) because the car manufacturer Toyota adopted the system in the 1970s. ● Kanban is a scheduling system often used in conjunction with JIT to avoid overcapacity of work in process. ● The success of the JIT production process relies on steady production, high- quality workmanship, no machine breakdowns, and reliable suppliers. ● The terms short-cycle manufacturing, used by Motorola, and continuous-flow manufacturing, used by IBM, are synonymous with the JIT system. Benefits of Kanban According to the 1st State of Kanban report, the leading reasons for adopting the Kanban method are the need for enhanced visibility of work and continuous improvement. Let’s reveal some more of the benefits of using Kanban today. ● Increased visibility of the flow ● Improved delivery speed ● Alignment between goals and execution ● Improved predictability ● Improved dependencies management ● Increased customer satisfaction Increased Visibility of the Flow The basic idea of Kanban is visualizing every piece of work. This way, the Kanban board turns into a central informational hub, and everyone is on the same page. All tasks are visible, and they never get lost, which brings transparency to the whole work process. Every team member can have a quick update on the status of every project or task. Improved Delivery Speed Kanban offers multiple ways for project managers to closely monitor and make informed analyses of the distribution of work. With a clear view over the work items completed for a certain period of time, the stages where tasks spend the longest, bottlenecks are easy to identify. Teams are enabled to tackle these challenges to ","674 improve their workflow and, ultimately, their delivery rate. Alignment between Business Goals and Execution Promoting transparency, encouraging feedback, and regular review meetings, Kanban practices enable aligning the company’s strategic goals with teams' day-to- day work. This alignment between the business direction and execution enhances the agility of an organization. It allows teams to adapt to changing priorities and reorganizations due to change in the market or customer’s requirements. Improved Predictability Once you create a Kanban board and start accumulating work items on it, you’ll be able to understand your process in depth with flow metrics. Analyzing the time tasks spend in your workflow (cycle time) will enable you to improve your predictions on how much work you can deliver in the future. Understanding your delivery rate consistency (throughput) will make your forecasts more accurate and your decisions based on historical data. Improved Ability to Manage Scale and Dependencies The intrinsic Kanban practice to visualization is also applied when it comes to mapping and managing dependencies. Starting with what you do now means visualizing the present dependencies and managing the flow between them. Managing dependencies provides both insights on the present state of a workflow and ideas for improvement. On the other hand, it also enables full transparency for strategic management over the workflow and the existing links between teams. Increased Customer Satisfaction The origin of the Kanban method - the pull system it is based on implies that work is done when there’s a demand. In other words, Kanban navigates you to reduce waste by working solely on tasks that are needed at present. Furthermore, by applying visualization techniques and introducing work-in-progress limits to the process, you will ensure that the end result is fine-tuned to your customer’s expectations. ","675 Scrum vs. Kanban The most important difference between Kanban and Scrum is that the former is a method, while the latter is a framework. Kanban builds a continuous delivery model where teams release value as soon as they are ready, while Scrum organizes work in Sprints. Applying either one depends on the nature of your process, however, it can be said that Kanban offers a more tailor-made approach while Scrum relies on predetermined rules. Another key distinguishing characteristic between the two is the mindset and founding belief systems of Scrum and Kanban. Kanban Scrum Nature Kanban is an adaptive method Scrum is a prescriptive framework Principles 1. Start with what you do now 2. Agree to pursue evolutionary change 3. Encourage acts of leadership at all levels 4. Focus on customer’s needs 5. Manage the work 6. Regularly review the network of services 1. Empiricism 2. Transparency 3. Inspection 4. Adaptation Cadences - Team-level cadences - Service-oriented cadences - Sprint with a fixed length - Sprint planning - Daily Scrum - Sprint Review - Sprint Retrospective Roles - Service Delivery Manager* - Service Request Manager* (*no predefined roles are required) - Product Owner - Scrum Master - Development Team ","676 Metrics - Cycle Time - Throughput - Work In Progress - Velocity - Planned Capacity Applying Kanban Across the Organization for Enterprise Agility By nature, Kanban is an adaptive method that is applicable at all organizational layers. You can use connected Kanban boards to map the management of your portfolios and connect strategy to execution. With the help of the Portfolio Kanban concept, organizations can reap the benefits of Kanban's principles and practices across multiple management levels. The Portfolio Kanban approach can be used in four different forms: ● Team level Portfolio Kanban ● Portfolio Kanban on the Project/Product level ● Portfolio Kanban on the Program level ● Portfolio Kanban on the Strategic level What Are the Main Kanban Terms You Should Know? At its core, Kanban is a work method that helps you optimize the flow of value through your value streams from ideation to customer. Although it looks like an easy way to improve your work processes, Kanban is more than visualizing your work. You need to pay attention to detail and get familiar with the basic Kanban terms and artifacts if you want to benefit from applying the method. Here is a short Kanban glossary that will help you get started. ● Kanban board: A Kanban board is one of the Kanban method's key components and is where you visualize all work items. It should be divided into a minimum of 3 columns – Requested, In Progress, Done, representing different process stages. ● Kanban card: Kanban cards represent the different work items moving through a Kanban board. They contain important details about the tasks such as description, deadline, size, assignees, etc. ","677 ● Columns: They split the Kanban board vertically, and each of them represents a different stage of the workflow. Each Kanban board has 3 default columns: Requested, In Progress, Done. Depending on the complexity of a work process, these three stages can be divided into many smaller sub-columns. ● Swimlanes: Horizontal lanes that split a Kanban board into sections. Teams use them to visually separate different work types on the same board and organize homogenous tasks together. ● Cycle Time: Cycle time begins at the moment when a new task enters the “in progress” stage of your workflow, and somebody is actually working on it. ● Lead Time: Lead time starts at the moment a new task is being requested (it doesn’t matter if somebody is actually working on it) and ends with its final departure from the system. ● Throughput: The number of work items passing through (completed) a system or process over a certain period. The throughput is a key indicator showing how productive your team is over time. ● Work in Progress (WIP): This is the amount of work you are currently working on and it is not finished yet. ● WIP limits: Limiting work in progress means limiting the number of tasks your team can work on simultaneously to avoid overburdening and context switching. ● Classes of Service: Set of policies that help Agile teams prioritize work items and projects. ● Kanban Cadences: Cyclical meetings that drive evolutionary change and “fit for purpose” service delivery. ● Kanban software: Refers to a digital system that allows the practical application of the Kanban practices and principles to be used by various teams and organizations of all sizes. Kanban in a Nutshell A Kanban system is more than sticky notes on the wall. The easiest way to understand Kanban is to embrace its philosophy and apply it to your daily work. If you read, understand, and resonate with its core principles, the practical transition would seem logical and even inevitable.Visualizing workflow, setting WIP limits, managing flow, ensuring explicit policies, and continuously improving will take your process far beyond what you could think. Remember to organize regular feedback loops, and all these pieces together will reveal Kanban's real power. ","678 Just In Time (JIT) - Inventory Management What is Just-in-Time (JIT)? Just-in-time, or JIT, is an inventory management method in which goods are received from suppliers only as they are needed. The main objective of this method is to reduce inventory holding costs and increase inventory turnover. Importance of just-in-time Just in time requires carefully planning the entire supply chain and usage of superior software in order to carry out the entire process till delivery, which increases efficiency and eliminates the scope for error as each process is monitored. Here are some of the important effects of a just-in-time inventory management system: ● Reduces inventory waste A just-in-time strategy eliminates overproduction, which happens when the supply of an item in the market exceeds the demand and leads to an accumulation of unsalable inventories. These unsalable products turn into inventory dead stock, which increases waste and consumes inventory space. In a just-in-time system you order only what you need, so there’s no risk of accumulating unusable inventory. ● Decreases warehouse holding cost Warehousing is expensive, and excess inventory can double your holding costs. In a just-in-time system, the warehouse holding costs are kept to a minimum. Because you order only when your customer places an order, your item is already sold before it reaches you, so there is no need to store your items for long. Companies that follow the just-in-time inventory model will be able to reduce the number of items in their warehouses or eliminate warehouses altogether. ● Gives the manufacturer more control ","679 In a JIT model, the manufacturer has complete control over the manufacturing process, which works on a demand-pull basis. They can respond to customers’ needs by quickly increasing the production for an in-demand product and reducing the production for slow-moving items. This makes the JIT model flexible and able to cater to ever-changing market needs. For example, Toyota doesn’t purchase raw materials until an order is received. This has allowed the company to keep minimal inventory, thereby reducing its costs and enabling it to quickly adapt to changes in demand without having to worry about existing inventory. ● Local sourcing Since just-in-time requires you to start manufacturing only when an order is placed, you need to source your raw materials locally as it will be delivered to your unit much earlier. Also, local sourcing reduces the transportation time and cost which is involved. This in turn provides the need for many complementary businesses to run in parallel thereby improving the employment rates in that particular demographic. ● Smaller investments In a JIT model, only essential stocks are obtained and therefore less working capital is needed for finance procurement. Therefore, because of the less amount of stock held in the inventory, the organization’s return on investment would be high. The Just-in-time model uses the “right first time” concept whose meaning is to carry out the activities right the first time when it’s done, thereby reducing inspection and rework costs. This requires less investment for the company, less money reinvested for rectifying errors and more profit generated out of selling an item. How does just-in-time work? The above image shows how a just-in-time model works. First, a customer places an order with the manufacturer. When the manufacturer receives the order, they place an order with their suppliers. The suppliers receive the order and then supply the manufacturer with the materials needed to meet the customer’s order. The raw materials are then received by the manufacturer, assembled, and sold to the customer. Drawbacks of just-in-time Even though the just-in-time model saves a lot of costs for businesses that use it, it also has a few drawbacks: ","680 1. Just-in-time makes it very difficult to rework orders, as the inventory is kept to a bare minimum and only based on the customers’ original orders. 2. The model is dependent on suppliers’ performance and timeliness, which are hard to ensure. Additionally, the manufacturer needs to be able to cover any sudden increases in the price of raw materials, since they cannot wait to order during better pricing. 3. Since the JIT model requires a lot of shipping back and forth between the supplier, manufacturer, and customer, it can have detrimental effects on the environment due to over consumption of fossil fuels and packaging. 4. In case of disruptions, a JIT model can have a major impact on the business. Since there is no excess stock to fall back on, sales may come to a halt. 5. A just-in-time system needs to be carefully tracked and organized, which will be hard if you are doing it manually. Software should be adopted as it makes the whole process more manageable. Even though good software helps you, it can be a bit tricky and/or expensive to adopt a new software system and train your personnel accordingly to use the same. Therefore, just in time saves you a lot of costs which would otherwise be tied up as inventory holding costs. At the same time, just in time should be executed carefully so that your business does not face loss in times of unpredictable events. ","681 CHAPTER 9: OVERALL EQUIPMENT EFFECTIVENESS (OEE) ","682 What is OEE? OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) is the gold standard for measuring manufacturing productivity. Simply put – it identifies the percentage of manufacturing time that is truly productive. An OEE score of 100% means you are manufacturing only Good Parts, as fast as possible, with no Stop Time. In the language of OEE that means 100% Quality (only Good Parts), 100% Performance (as fast as possible), and 100% Availability (no Stop Time). Measuring OEE is a manufacturing best practice. By measuring OEE and the underlying losses, you will gain important insights on how to systematically improve your manufacturing process. OEE is the single best metric for identifying losses, benchmarking progress, and improving the productivity of manufacturing equipment (i.e., eliminating waste). ● Availability Availability takes into account Unplanned and Planned Stops. An Availability score of 100% means the process is always running during Planned Production Time. ● Performance Performance takes into account Slow Cycles and Small Stops. A Performance score of 100% means when the process is running it is running as fast as possible. ● Quality Quality takes into account Defects (including parts that need Rework). A Quality score of 100% means there are no Defects (only Good Parts are being produced). Overall Equipment Effectiveness OEE takes into account all losses. An OEE score of 100% means you are manufacturing only Good Parts, as fast as possible, with no Stop Time. ","683 OEE FACTORS Your OEE score tells you where you are at, but the three underlying factors (Availability, Performance, and Quality) tell you where you should focus your improvement efforts. Where do we start? Let’s start at the beginning – with All Time. This is also called 24/7 time (it includes every minute of every day). Chart of All Time if you were producing 24/7 From All Time, you subtract Schedule Loss, which includes all time that should be excluded from OEE analysis because there is no intention of running production during this time (e.g., plant shutdowns, breaks/lunches, or periods where there are no orders). Schedule Loss is part of TEEP (Total Effective Equipment Performance). It is not part of OEE. The remaining time is your Planned Production Time. OEE begins with Planned Production Time and scrutinizes all efficiency and productivity losses that occur within that time, with the goal of reducing or eliminating these losses. Chart of Planned Production Time, the time that manufacturing equipment is expected to produce Now we will look at the three OEE factors, each of which takes into account a different type of loss. They are Availability, Performance and Quality. OEE Availability Availability takes into account Availability Loss, which includes any events that stop planned production for an appreciable length of time (usually several minutes; long enough for an operator to log a reason). Examples of things that create Availability Loss include Unplanned Stops (such as equipment failures and material shortages), and Planned Stops (such as changeover ","684 time). Changeover time is included in OEE analysis, since it is time that could otherwise be used for manufacturing. While it may not be possible to eliminate changeover time, in most cases it can be significantly reduced. Reducing changeover time is the goal of SMED (Single-Minute Exchange of Die). The remaining time after Availability Loss is subtracted is called Run Time. Chart of calculating Run Time by subtracting downtime from planned production time OEE Performance Performance takes into account Performance Loss, which accounts for anything that causes the manufacturing process to run at less than the maximum possible speed when it is running (including both Slow Cycles and Small Stops). Examples of things that create Performance Loss include machine wear, substandard materials, misfeeds, and jams. The remaining time after Performance Loss is subtracted is called Net Run Time. Chart of Net Run Time after performance, schedule and availability losses are subtracted OEE Quality Quality takes into account Quality Loss, which accounts for manufactured parts that do not meet quality standards. Examples of things that create Quality Loss include scrap and parts that need rework. OEE Quality is similar to First Pass Yield, in that it defines Good Parts as parts that successfully pass through the manufacturing process the first time without needing any rework. The remaining time after Quality Loss is subtracted is called Fully Productive Time.Chart of Fully Productive Time, the productive time after all losses are subtracted Goal is not simply to measure OEE – it is to maximize Fully Productive Time. ","685 OEE Quick Review: Loss & factors Now that you have taken a look at how the three OEE Factors are defined we can quickly review each type of loss and its relationship to the OEE factors. LOSS OEE FACTOR Schedule Loss ● Not part of the OEE calculation (it is part of the TEEP calculation). Availability Loss ● Availability is the ratio of Run Time to Planned Production Time. ● It takes into account Equipment Failure (unplanned stops) and Setup and Adjustments (planned stops) from the Six Big Losses. ● 100% Availability means the process is running during Planned Production Time without any Stop Time (without any Unplanned or Planned Stops). Performance Loss ● Performance is the ratio of Net RunTime to Run Time. ● It takes into account Idling and Minor Stops (small stops) and Reduced Speed (speed loss) from the Six Big Losses. ● 100% Performance means the manufacturing process is running at its theoretical maximum speed (when it is running). ","686 Quality Loss ● Quality is the ratio of Fully Productive Time to Net Run Time. ● It takes into account Process Defects (production rejects) and Reduced Yield (startup rejects) from the Six Big Losses. ● 100% Quality means there are no scrap parts or parts needing rework. As you can see, the core concepts of OEE are quite simple and the three OEE Factors really help to focus us on the underlying causes of productivity loss. IMPLEMENT OEE Knowing your OEE score is a good starting point, but you need to capture detailed loss data in order to take action and improve manufacturing productivity. MEASURING OEE Roadmap of key decisions and is organized in three parts: ● Define Project: things to decide before you start your OEE project ● Capture OEE Data: everything you need to calculate OEE ● Capture Detailed Loss Data: everything you need to calculate Availability, Performance, and Quality Define Your Project Select Pilot Area When implementing any new initiative, it is usually best to start small and expand from a base of success. For OEE, that means starting with a pilot implementation on a single machine, cell, or line. Creating an OEE score at multiple points will give you conflicting information and potentially lead you to focus on less critical aspects of your process. Select a pilot area where your employees are engaged and motivated; ideally an area ","687 where employees are interested in learning new things and applying ideas towards improvement. Preferably, select a pilot area that manufactures either one part or multiple parts with the same cycle time. Identify Constraint OEE should be measured at the constraint step of your process (sometimes referred to as the bottleneck). The constraint is the single step or machine that governs (i.e., limits) the throughput of the overall process. Improving the constraint will improve the overall process. If the constraint moves because you’ve improved the former constraint, move your OEE measurement to the new constraint and start again. Choose Measurement Method OEE measurement can be manual or automated. We recommend starting with manual OEE measurement. It reinforces the underlying concepts and provides a deeper understanding of OEE. Later, you may want to automate data collection to improve accuracy, track the Six Big Losses, and to generate top losses and other reports. Capture OEE Data Only three pieces of information are needed to calculate OEE: Good Count, Ideal Cycle Time, and Planned Production Time. Good Count Good Count should only include parts that are defect-free the first time through the process. This is similar in concept to First Pass Yield, which defines good parts as units that pass through the manufacturing process the first time without needing rework. Identify how you will collect Good Count. For manual measurement look for a counter immediately after the constraint that reliably counts good parts. For automated measurement look for a sensor immediately after the constraint that is triggered only for good parts. ","688 Ideal Cycle Time Ideal Cycle Time is the theoretical minimum time to produce one part (it is NOT a ‘budget’ or ‘standard’ time). It is important that Ideal Cycle Time be a true and honest measure of how fast the process can run, even if the process currently runs slower due to product, material, or equipment problems. Determine the Ideal Cycle Time. The preferred method is to use Nameplate Capacity (the design capacity specified by the equipment builder). An alternate method is to perform a time study (measuring the absolute fastest speed the process can support). Planned Production Time Planned Production Time is the total time that the manufacturing process is scheduled for production. It is the yardstick against which Fully Productive Time is measured. Start with shift time and decide if certain types of planned stops will be excluded (i.e., will not count against OEE). Most companies exclude only breaks (including lunches) and meetings. Capture Detailed OEE Loss data In order to leverage OEE to improve manufacturing productivity it is essential to calculate the three OEE factors: Availability, Performance, and Quality. This requires two more pieces of information: Run Time and Total Count. Since in practice Run Time is calculated as Planned Production Time less Stop Time, we need to collect Stop Time. Stop Time Stop Time is defined as all time where the manufacturing process was intended to be running but was not due to unplanned stops (e.g., breakdowns) or planned stops (e.g., changeovers). Decide how to record stop time. For manual measurement a tick sheet is usually the easiest way to collect stop time (an alternative is to record start and end times for each stop). For automated measurement the data collection system will automatically record these times. ","689 Decide the time threshold for recording stops. Any stop that reaches the threshold is recorded and is included as Stop Time (an Availability Loss). Any stop shorter than the threshold is considered a small stop (a Performance Loss) and is not recorded. A typical stop threshold is five minutes for manual systems and two minutes for automated systems. Total Count Total Count is required to measure OEE Quality. It can be measured directly, or Reject Count can be measured instead, and added to Good Count to calculate Total Count. Decide if you will measure Total Count or Reject Count. For manual measurement of Total Count look for a counter that counts all parts going into the constraint. For automated measurement of Total Count look for a sensor before the constraint that is triggered for all parts. Reject Count is measured in the same place as Good Count . Changeover Policy Measure changeover time consistently by defining the start and end points of each event. Document a policy for measuring Changeover Time. Three common options are: ● First Good Part is measured as the time between the last good part produced (before setup) to the first good part produced (after setup). ● Consistent Good Parts is measured as the time between the last good part produced (before setup) to the first instance of consistently producing parts that meet quality standards (after setup). ● Full Speed is measured as the last good part produced at full speed (before setup) to the first good part produced at full speed (after setup). Stop Reasons Stop reasons provide insights as to why the process has stopped – especially for unplanned stops. They are an essential part of any manufacturing improvement program. Create a starting list of stop reasons. Here are some tips: ● Start simple (10 reasons). ● Create a catch-all reason (All Other Losses). ","690 ● Make sure every reason is clear and unambiguous. ● Make sure every reason describes symptoms. ● Remove reasons that aren't regularly used. ● Add reasons if ‘All Other Losses’ is in the top ten losses. Using OEE Data Now you have a good understanding of how to define a project, how to gather the data you need in order to calculate OEE, and how to capture and calculate detailed loss data. You also have a roadmap of key decisions to make along the way. Use this information to start small and measure the OEE score in your pilot area, and then expand until you know the OEE of every line in your plant! Once you have an accurate measure of your OEE score, you can expand your improvement journey by learning how to calculate TEEP, as well as how to use the information you have gathered to improve OEE. World Class OEE There is no one ideal OEE score or OEE industry standard to use as a benchmark for every company. Rather, the best OEE target for your company is one that steadily and incrementally improves! WHAT IS WORLD-CLASS OEE? OEE is the ratio of Fully Productive Time to Planned Production Time (refer to the OEE Factors page for a graphical representation). It is calculated as the product of its three constituent factors: OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality The nature of this calculation makes achieving a high OEE score quite challenging. ","691 For example, if all three factors are 90%, the resultant OEE will only be 73%. In practice, the generally accepted world-class goals for each factor are quite different from each other, as is shown in the image below. Note that these figures apply to discrete manufacturing (as opposed to process industries). PM and World Class OEE People often ask – where do these World-Class OEE numbers come from? The answer is simple. Seiichi Nakajima led the introduction of TPM, OEE and the Six Big Losses in the early 1970s while at the Japanese Institute of Plant Maintenance. In his 1984 book, Introduction to TPM (translated to English and published in 1988 by Productivity Press), Seiichi Nakajima included the above four “world-class” numbers. Seiichi defined these numbers, based on his practical experience, as minimums for which companies should strive. He also noted that all of the companies winning the Distinguished Plant Prize, awarded annually in Japan to plants that had successfully implemented TPM, had OEE scores in excess of 85%. Simple OEE Calculation The simplest way to calculate OEE is as the ratio of Fully Productive Time to Planned Production Time. Fully Productive Time is just another way of saying manufacturing only Good Parts as fast as possible (Ideal Cycle Time) with no Stop Time. Hence the calculation is: OEE = (Good Count × Ideal Cycle Time) / Planned Production Time Although this is an entirely valid calculation of OEE, it does not provide information about the three loss-related factors: Availability, Performance, and Quality. For that – we use the preferred calculation. ","692 Preferred OEE Calculation The preferred OEE calculation is based on the three OEE Factors: Availability, Performance, and Quality. OEE is calculated by multiplying the three OEE factors: Availability, Performance, and Quality. Availability Availability takes into account all events that stop planned production long enough where it makes sense to track a reason for being down (typically several minutes). Availability is calculated as the ratio of Run Time to Planned Production Time: Availability = Runtime / Planned Production Time Run Time is simply Planned Production Time less Stop Time, where Stop Time is defined as all time where the manufacturing process was intended to be running but was not due to Unplanned Stops (e.g., Breakdowns) or Planned Stops (e.g.Changeovers). ","693 Run Time = Planned Production Time − Stop Time Performance Performance takes into account anything that causes the manufacturing process to run at less than the maximum possible speed when it is running (including both Slow Cycles and Small Stops). Performance is the ratio of Net RunTime to Run Time. It is calculated as: Performance = (Ideal Cycle Time × Total Count) / Run Time Ideal Cycle Time is the fastest cycle time that your process can achieve in optimal circumstances. Therefore, when it is multiplied by Total Count the result is Net Run Time (the fastest possible time to manufacture the parts). Since rate is the reciprocal of time, Performance can also be calculated as: Performance = (Total Count / Run Time) / Ideal Run Rate Performance should never be greater than 100%. If it is, that usually indicates that Ideal Cycle Time is set incorrectly (it is too high). Quality Quality takes into account manufactured parts that do not meet quality standards, including parts that need rework. Remember, OEE Quality is similar to First Pass Yield, in that it defines Good Parts as parts that successfully pass through the manufacturing process the first time without needing any rework. Quality is calculated as: Quality = Good Count / Total Count This is the same as taking the ratio of Fully Productive Time (only Good Parts manufactured as fast as possible with no Stop Time) to Net Run Time (all parts manufactured as fast as possible with no stop time). OEE Formula OEE takes into account all losses, resulting in a measure of truly productive manufacturing time. It is calculated as: OEE = Availability × Performance × Quality If the equations for Availability, Performance, and Quality are substituted in the above and reduced to their simplest terms, the result is: OEE = (Good Count × Ideal Cycle Time) / Planned Production Time This is the “simplest” OEE calculation described earlier. And, as described earlier, multiplying Good Count by Ideal Cycle Time results in Fully Productive Time (manufacturing only Good Parts, as fast as possible, with no Stop Time). ","694 Why the Preferred OEE Calculation? OEE scores provide a very valuable insight – an accurate picture of how effectively your manufacturing process is running. And, it makes it easy to track improvements in that process over time. What your OEE score doesn’t provide is any insights as to the underlying causes of lost productivity. This is the role of Availability, Performance, and Quality. In the preferred calculation you get the best of both worlds. A single number that captures how well you are doing (OEE) and three numbers that capture the fundamental nature of your losses (Availability, Performance, and Quality). SIX BIG LOSSES The three OEE factors map to the Six Big Losses, providing a concrete and ","695 manageable framework within which to categorize your losses. This makes it easier to see where your improvement efforts can have the greatest impact. OEE AND TPM LOSSES One of the major goals of TPM and OEE programs is to reduce and/or eliminate what are called the Six Big Losses – the most common causes of equipment-based productivity loss in manufacturing. First, let’s define the Six Big Losses. ● EQUIPMENT FAILURE Equipment Failure accounts for any significant period of time in which equipment is scheduled for production but is not running due to a failure of some sort. A more generalized way to think of equipment failure is as any unplanned stop or downtime. Equipment Failure is an Availability Loss. Examples of common reasons for Equipment Failure include tooling failure, breakdowns, and unplanned maintenance. From the broader perspective of unplanned stops, other common reasons include lack of operators or materials, being starved by upstream equipment, or being blocked by downstream equipment. There is flexibility on where to set the threshold between Equipment Failure (an ","696 Availability Loss) and a minor stop (a Performance Loss). A good rule of thumb is to set that threshold based on your policy for tracking reasons. For example, your policy might be that any downtime longer than two minutes should have a reason associated with it – and thus shall be considered Equipment Failure. ● SETUP AND ADJUSTMENTS Setup and Adjustments accounts for any significant periods of time in which equipment is scheduled for production but is not running due to a changeover or other equipment adjustment. A more generalized way to think of Setups & Adjustments is as any planned stop. Setup and Adjustments is an Availability Loss. Examples of common reasons for Setup and Adjustments include setup, changeovers, major adjustments, and tooling adjustments. From the broader perspective of planned stops, other common reasons include cleaning, warmup time, planned maintenance, and quality inspections. The largest source of Setup and Adjustment time is typically changeovers (also referred to as make ready or setup), which can be addressed through a SMED (Single-Minute Exchange of Die) program. ● IDLING AND MINOR STOPS Idling and Minor Stops accounts for time where the equipment stops for a short period of time (typically a minute or two) with the stop resolved by the operator. Another name for Idling and Minor Stops is small stops. Idling and Minor Stops is a Performance Loss. Examples of common reasons for Idling and Minor Stops include misfeeds, material jams, obstructed product flow, incorrect settings, misaligned or blocked sensors, equipment design issues, and periodic quick cleaning. This category usually includes stops that are well under five minutes and that do not require maintenance personnel. The underlying problems are often chronic (same problem/different day), which can make operators somewhat blind to their impact. Most companies do not accurately track Idling and Minor Stops. ● REDUCED SPEED Reduced Speed accounts for time where equipment runs slower than the Ideal Cycle Time (the theoretical fastest possible time to manufacture one part). Another name for reduced speed is slow cycles. Reduced speed is a Performance Loss. Examples of common reasons for reduced speed include dirty or worn out equipment, poor lubrication, substandard materials, poor environmental conditions, operator inexperience, startup, and shutdown. ","697 This category includes anything that keeps the process from running at its theoretical maximum speed (a.k.a. Ideal Run Rate or Nameplate Capacity) when the manufacturing process is actually running. ● PROCESS DEFECTS Process Defects account for defective parts produced during stable (steady-state) production. This includes scrapped parts as well as parts that can be reworked, since OEE measures quality from a First Pass Yield perspective. Process defects are a Quality Loss. Examples of common reasons for process defects include incorrect equipment settings, operator or equipment handling errors, and lot expiration (e.g., in pharmaceutical plants). ● REDUCED YIELD Reduced Yield accounts for defective parts produced from startup until stable (steady-state) production is reached. This includes scrapped parts as well as parts that can be reworked, since OEE measures quality from a First Pass Yield perspective. Reduced Yield can occur after any equipment startup, however, it is most commonly tracked after changeovers. Reduced Yield is a Quality Loss. Examples of common reasons for Reduced Yield include suboptimal changeovers, incorrect settings when a new part is run, equipment that needs warm up cycles, or equipment that inherently creates waste after startup (e.g., a web press). ","698 Using the Six Big Losses framework Using the Six Big Losses framework creates a concrete path to improve your OEE score. Working to reduce Availability Loss in the form of Equipment Failures or Setups and Adjustments protects you against preventable unplanned stops or downtime, as well as minimizes any planned stops. Addressing Performance Loss that results from Idling and Minor Stops, as well as Reduced Speed, prevents small stops and slow cycles from accumulating. Finally, minimizing Quality Loss in the form of Process Defects and Reduced Yield reduces the number of unusable parts produced before and during steady-state production. In all, the Six Big Losses name and categorize problems that manufacturers face every day. Consistently working within this framework to take action, one loss at a time, will result in a consistently improving OEE score. ","699 How To Improve OEE To start improving your OEE score, all you need is accurate data, an intentional decision about where to focus your efforts, and follow-through on your plan. We call it IDA - Information, Decision, Action. Three Methodologies For Improving OEE The three most popular manufacturing improvement methodologies are Lean Manufacturing, Six Sigma, and Theory of Constraints. OEE was developed as part of Lean Manufacturing – specifically as part of the powerful and holistic improvement process known as TPM (Total Productive Maintenance). All of these methodologies have a great deal to offer for manufacturing improvement. None of these methodologies are easy. As a result, we are often asked – is there a way to get started while we put a comprehensive program in place? The answer is yes. A Fourth Methodology: IDA This page introduces a simple and universal methodology for driving any improvement activity and shows you how to apply it to OEE. The methodology is known as IDA (Information, Decision, Action). IDA emphasizes three factors: ● Information: Information is the foundation and starting point of IDA. Excellent information (i.e., accurate, relevant, and easy-to-understand) is a precondition for effective decision-making. ● Decision: Decisions are the pivot between Information and Action. It is the moment in time when Information is reviewed and a course of Action is decided. ● Action: Action is where theoretical possibilities are transformed into tangible progress; where Decisions are transformed into Results. IDA is simple and universal. You may have noticed that the equation looks a lot like OEE. Three factors are multiplied together to get an answer: Availability × Performance × Quality = OEE Information × Decision × Action = Result Just like OEE, all three factors are needed to get a good result. Here’s an example. Imagine you are a pilot and it's your job to safely fly passengers from Chicago to London. In each of the following three scenarios there is an IDA problem that will prevent you ","700 from meeting your objective: ● The gauges are inaccurate or broken (Information problem) ● The gauges are accurate but you don’t use them to chart your course (Decision problem) ● The gauges are accurate and you look at them; but you don't bother to make any adjustments to the flight controls (Action problem) Like a chain, IDA is only as strong as its weakest link. All three factors (Information, Decision, and Action) must be present and in balance to achieve optimal results. IDA is simple enough to be understood by all employees and broad enough to serve as a core tool for forwarding the goals of the business. By establishing behaviors that optimize the inputs (Information, Decision, and Action), the outputs (Results) will take care of themselves. ","701 Total Productive Maintenance Getting operators involved in maintaining their own equipment, and emphasizing proactive and preventive maintenance will lay a foundation for improved production (fewer breakdowns, stops, and defects). WHAT IS TPM? TPM (Total Productive Maintenance) is a holistic approach to equipment maintenance that strives to achieve perfect production: ● No Breakdowns ● No Small Stops or Slow Running ● No Defects ● In addition it values a safe working environment: No Accidents TPM emphasizes proactive and preventative maintenance to maximize the operational efficiency of equipment. It blurs the distinction between the roles of production and maintenance by placing a strong emphasis on empowering operators to help maintain their equipment. The implementation of a TPM program creates a shared responsibility for equipment that encourages greater involvement by plant floor workers. In the right environment this can be very effective in improving productivity (increasing up time, reducing cycle times, and eliminating defects). TRADITIONAL TPM PILLARS The traditional approach to TPM was developed in the 1960s and consists of 5S as a foundation and eight supporting activities (sometimes referred to as pillars). The Eight TPM Pillars The eight pillars of TPM are mostly focused on proactive and preventative techniques for improving equipment reliability. ","702 PILLAR WHAT IS IT? HOW DOES IT HELP? Autonomous Maintenance Places responsibility for routine maintenance, such as cleaning, lubricating, and inspection, in the hands of operators. ● Gives operators greater “ownership” of their equipment. ● Increases operators’ knowledge of their equipment. ● Ensures equipment is well-cleaned and lubricated. ● Identifies emergent issues before they become failures. ● Frees maintenance personnel for higher-level tasks. Planned Maintenance Schedules maintenance tasks based on predicted and/or measured failure rates. ● Significantly reduces instances of unplanned stop time. ● Enables most maintenance to be planned for times when equipment is not scheduled for production. ● Reduces inventory through better control of wear-prone and failure- prone parts. ","703 Quality Maintenance Design error detection and prevention into production processes. Apply Root Cause Analysis to eliminate recurring sources of quality defects. ● Specifically targets quality issues with improvement projects focused on removing root sources of defects. ● Reduces the number of defects. ● Reduces cost by catching defects early (it is expensive and unreliable to find defects through inspection). Focused Improvement Have small groups of employees work together proactively to achieve regular, incremental improvement s in equipment operation. ● Recurring problems are identified and resolved by cross-functional teams. ● Combines the collective talents of a company to create an engine for continuous improvement. ","704 Early Equipment Management Directs practical knowledge and understandin g of manufacturin g equipment gained through TPM towards improving the design of new equipment. ● New equipment reaches planned performance levels much faster due to fewer startup issues. ● Maintenance is simpler and more robust due to practical review and employee involvement prior to installation. Training and Education Fill in knowledge gaps necessary to achieve TPM goals. Applies to operators, maintenance personnel and managers. ● Operators develop skills to routinely maintain equipment and identify emerging problems. ● Maintenance personnel learn techniques for proactive and preventative maintenance. ● Managers are trained on TPM principles as well as on employee coaching and development. Safety, Health, Environment Maintain a safe and healthy working environment. ● Eliminates potential health and safety risks, resulting in a safer workplace. ● Specifically targets the goal of an accident-free workplace. ","705 TPM in Administration Apply TPM techniques to administrativ e functions. ● Extends TPM benefits beyond the plant floor by addressing waste in administrative functions. ● Supports production through improved administrative operations (e.g., order processing, procurement, and scheduling). ","706 DMADV (Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, and Validate) DMADV is a Six Sigma framework that focuses on the development of a new product, service, or process. It is an acronym for the five phases of DMADV: define, measure, analyze, design, and verify. The DMADV approach is useful when implementing new strategies because of its early identification of success, basis in data, and thorough analysis. The aim of the DMADV framework is to ensure the optimum balance between three perspectives, namely the customer's needs, the process or procedure to fulfill these needs, and the goal or objective of the company. It is a general strategic- level approach that tries to help in solving problems related to the development of a new product, service, or process, and its implementation and control. The DMADV model has been in use for over three decades in various industries, including manufacturing, service industries, transportation industry, etc., with significant success. One of the main disadvantages of the DMADV method is that its implementation takes precedence over creativity and innovation. The DMADV development is linear, but in reality, it needs to be iterative due to the complexity of most projects. DMADV needs to be agile and flexible in order to produce better projects. Further, DMADV is a popular Design for Six Sigma methodology, which was invented at Motorola in the 1980s. Bill Smith and Mikel Harry developed Six Sigma to make improvements on the manufacturing floor. ","707 What Is DMADV Used for? DMADV is an important Design for Six Sigma methodology used for developing a new product, service, or process. There’s a modified version called DFSS, or Design for Six Sigma, and the process most often used in DFSS is called DMADV. The DMADV methodology is implemented for inventing and innovating a completely new product, service, or process, or for inventing and innovating major new features of an existing product, service, or process. The DMADV focuses on resolving issues of tomorrow. The DMADV approach is very critical to problem- solving within any enterprise using Six Sigma in their product and service development processes. What does DMADV Stand for? DMADV is an acronym for define, measure, analyze, design, and verify. 1. Define Define the first phase of the DMADV methodology, where the project goals and customer deliverables are identified. The purpose of this step is to clearly identify the business problem, goal, project scope, available resources, and high-level project timeline. A clear definition of the project must be established during this step, and every strategy and goal needs to be aligned with the expectations of the company and the customers. 2. Measure The purpose of the Measure phase is to clearly understand the customer’s requirements and develop the critical to quality (CTQs) to address those requirements. This is achieved by dividing the market into different segments and then developing CTQs for each segment. For each identified CTQ, measurement and metrics systems must be created. These systems will then help to capture the performance of the Critical to Quality attributes (CTQs). 3. Analysis Analysis is the third phase of the DMADV methodology. In this phase, the best ","708 design concepts that will address the voice of the customer demands (CTQ) are developed. The purpose of the Analyze phase is to generate alternative design concepts for each CTQ, evaluate the alternative design concepts for each CTQ, combine the best parts of the design concepts to create the final design. 4. Design Design is the fourth phase of the DMADV methodology. In this phase, the best design concept that developed in the Analyze Phase must be converted into a prototype. The purpose of the Design phase is to create a prototype of the design model that will be studied in the Verify phase. 5. Verify Verify is the fifth and the last phase of the DMADV methodology. In this phase, the prototype of the best design is validated for its intended functions by testing the design. This is done to make sure that the design meets the customer’s requirements, like no damage being induced to packaging during distribution and product protection. The purpose of the Verify phase is to test the prototype of the detailed design, inspect the samples after testing, decide whether or not to scale up the design, and close the DMADV project. When should DMADV be Used? DMADV is used to design a new process or product or to completely redesign an existing product or process, and it should be used by incorporating the following phases consequently. First, you have to define the process and its design goals. Second, you have to identify and measure CTQs characteristics of the service, product, or process. Third, you have to analyze the data to find the best possible design. In the fourth phase, design, you have to create and test the prototype of the product, service, or process. And in the final fifth phase, you have to verify that the design output meets the design input requirements and that the designed product performs satisfactorily under real conditions. ","709 What Are the Advantages of Using the DMADV Process? The main advantages of using the DMADV process can be characterized by the following features. ● The DMADV process is customer-driven. ● The DMADV process helps to achieve maximum customer satisfaction while increasing profits. ● The DMADV process helps to reduce defects. ● The DMADV process focuses on the entire production and planning process. ● The DMADV process helps to establish areas for improvement before encountering defects. What Are the Examples of DMADV Usage? The DMADV process is used in many industries. Examples of DMADV usage in industries is listed below. ● In packaging, to design a new package for a product or to improve an existing package. ● In health care, to design high-quality products, where defects in healthcare products may lead to death. ● In manufacturing, to eliminate defects in any process, from manufacturing to transactional and from product to service. ● In different fields of service providers. For example, a service provider who wants to introduce a new customer service team may use DMADV to design how many staff are required to be present in each shift or what would be the turn-around time that the team can respond to its customers. What Is the Difference between DMADV and DMAIC? Both DMADV and DMAIC are part of the philosophy of Lean Six Sigma. The main difference between DMADV and DMAIC is that DMADV focuses on the development of new processes, services, or products, while DMAIC is used to improve an existing process. DMADV measures customer specifications and needs, while DMAIC measures the performance of a process. While DMAIC focuses on improving a ","710 business process to reduce and eliminate defects, DMADV develops business models to meet customers’ requirements. Further, as DMADV is associated with new projects and product services, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it will work with existing processes and products. For example, if a process improvement doesn’t meet what’s expected or it fails, it might be time to use the DMADV framework. Similarly, when an existing process or product no longer meets customers’ specifications or needs, the DMAIC method must be used. The best way to remember their difference is that DMADV works best for launching new features, products, or projects, while DMAIC is designed to enhance a process, product, or service that the organization will keep selling. ","711 Design for Excellence (Design for X) Design for Excellence (aka Design for X, DFX) is a systematic approach to achieve a targeted objective. X represents targeted objectives or characteristics of product or process. DFX comes under the topic of DFSS which requires a cross-functional team approach with the involvement of stakeholders. In order to stay successful in the marketplace, companies need to meet customer expectations. Continuous feedback mechanisms should inform efforts to understand and solve these demands. Typical Design for X (DFX) considerations: ● cost ● quality ● reliability ● recyclability ","712 Types of Design for X (DFX) ● Design for Manufacturing/Assembly (DFM & DFMA) Design for Manufacturing (DFM) deals with steps for improving the manufacturing process to make a good product with reduced manufacturing cost. Product design can be optimized to achieve this goal. Potential DFM factors: ➢ materials ➢ tooling ➢ environment ➢ testing ➢ tolerances ● Design for Cost and Design to Cost (DTC) Low cost cannot be managed into a product; it must be engineered into a product. This can be challenging when a company has a fixed design cost yet still has to meet customer expectations. Design for cost and DTC consist of several life cycle cost controlling techniques. Designing for cost works on engineering principles but DTC is more related to management requirements. DTC uses value analysis (aka Design to Value) to quantify the value that can be delivered to the customer. Redesign and reworking costs should be considered. ● Design for Testing/Testability (DFT) Testing is a major part in the process to ensure that products have predetermined quality standards demanded by the customers. In this stage the team has to design steps that are required for validating the product to ensure that it doesn’t have any defects and it is properly functioning. ● Design for Maintainability (DFM) Maintainability is how easily a product can be maintained. Here, the design team ","713 gives attention to reducing maintenance costs. Eg preventive maintenance and corrective maintenance. ● Design for Robustness Robustness is the ability of the system to reduce variations while delivering defined outputs. Chief considerations here are structural and environmental. ● Design for Supply Chain (DFSC) Target here is to design a system with high supply chain efficiency, less inventory cost and less or zero waste. Error detection should be considered in the design step. ● Design for Safety This is one of the important design aspects which every team has to be focused on. Not only do strict safety regulations and requirements mandate safety standards, employee engagement demands it. DFS helps to bring illness & injuries to a minimum while maintaining productivity. Common techniques could be as simple as adequate usage of personal protective equipment (PPE). ","714 Major Production Losses ● Equipment failure (Breakdowns) loss Time loss that results from sporadic (unscheduled) plant stoppage where plant or equipment ceases to function as specified. The failure can be classified into two types, one is the function-stoppage type and the other is the function deterioration type. The function-stoppage type failure is the one which occurs unexpectedly, while the function-deterioration type failure is the one in which the equipment function decreases. ● Changeover (Setup & adjustment) loss This loss is usually caused by a stoppage due to set-up change. The set-up change time is the period during which the production is stopped to prepare for subsequent Production. The factor which spends the most time is \"adjustment\". ● Cutting tools & jig change loss The cutting tools change loss is caused by the line stoppage for replacing the grinding wheel, cutter, bit etc. which might be broken or worn due to long service. ","715 ● Minor stoppage & idling loss The minor stoppage loss differs from failure and is the one in which temporary trouble causes the equipment to stop or idle. It might be called a \"minor trouble.\" For example, idling of a line caused by a low supply of work in the chute due to clogging, and temporary line stops caused when the sensor detects a non- conforming product are examples of minor stoppage loss. These losses can be eliminated and the line returned to normal operation so long as the clogged work is removed. The losses are quite different from natural equipment failure losses. ● Speed loss The speed loss is the loss caused by the difference between the designed speed and the actual working speed. For example, when the line was operated at the designed speed. it was found that the line caused poor quality or mechanical trouble in the line. In that case, the line had to be run at a slower speed than the designed one. This loss from this situation is called a speed loss. ● Defect & rework loss This is the loss caused when defects are found and have to be reworked. In general, the defects are likely to be considered as waste which should be disposed of. But since even the reworked products need wasted manpower to repair them, this must be considered as the loss. ● Start-up loss The start-up loss is the one that occurs until the start-up, running-in and machining conditions of the equipment have been stabilized. ● Scheduled downtime - SD (shutdown) loss This loss is referred to as line shut-down loss, which is caused by stopping the equipment for periodical maintenance/inspection, and for scheduled shutdown for legal inspection during the production stage.
